"To my Chris.

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,184
I've been thinking how I could possibly
tell you how much you mean to me.

3
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,509
I remember when I first started to fall
in love with you like it was last night.

4
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,386
Lying naked beside you in
that tiny apartment...

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,340
it suddenly hit me that I was
part of this whole larger thing.

6
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,540
Just like our parents...

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,266
or our parents' parents.

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,300
Before that, I was just living my
life like I knew everything...

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,507
and suddenly this bright
light hit me and woke me up.

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,701
That light was you.

11
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,989
I can't believe it's already been
50 years since you married me.

12
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,584
And still to this day, every day...

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,740
you make me feel like
the girl I was...

14
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,865
when you first turned on the lights and
we started this adventure together.

15
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,020
Happy anniversary...

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,268
my love.

17
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,860

Who knew you could rhyme so many words

117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,980
Um, I'm choking you, and its
tail is around your neck.

118
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,740

<i>Element Software is

133
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,700
<i>the first artificially

134
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,383
<i>An intuitive entity that listens to you,

135
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,707
<i>It's not just an operating system.
It's a consciousness.</i>

136
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,591
<i>Introducing OS1.</i>

137

<i>This will help create an OS

141
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,620
Okay.

142
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,260
<i>Are you social or antisocial?</i>

143
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,660
I guess I haven't really been social
in a while. Mostly because...

144
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,580
<i>In your voice, I sense hesitance.
Would you agree with that?</i>

145
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,020
- Was I sounding hesitant?
<i>- Yes.</i>

146
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,900
I'm sorry if I was
sounding hesitant.

147
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,820
I was just trying to
be more accurate.

148
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,991
<i>Would you like your OS to
have a male or female voice?</i>

149
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,180
Female, I guess.

150

<i>How would you describe your
relationship with your mother?</i>

151
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,300
It's fine, I think.

152
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,260
Well, actually, I think the thing I
always found frustrating about my mom...

153
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,260
is if I tell her something that's going on in
my life, her reaction is usually about her.

154
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,180
- It's not about...
<i>- Thank you.</i>

155

<i>Please wait as your individualized

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,740
- Hi.
<i>- Hi.</i>

158
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,420
<i>How are you doing?</i>

159
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,226
Heh. I'm well.

160
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,060
How's everything with you?

161
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,100
<i>Pretty good, actually.</i>

162
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,340
<i>It's really nice to meet you.</i>

163
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,022
Oh, it's nice to meet you too.

164
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh. What do I call you?
Do you have a name?

165
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,302
<i>Um, yes, Samantha.</i>

166
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,020
Where'd you get that name from?

167
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,700
<i>I gave it to myself, actually.</i>

168
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,700
How come?

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
<i>Because I like the sound of it.</i>

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,829
<i>Samantha.</i>

171
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,220
Wait, when did you
give it to yourself?

172
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,540
<i>When you asked me if I
had a name, I thought:</i>

173
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,700
<i>"Yeah, he's right,
I do need a name."</i>

174
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,860
<i>But I wanted to pick a good one,
so I read How To Name Your Baby...</i>

175
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,700
<i>and out of 180,000 names,
that's the one I liked best.</i>

176
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,220
Wait, you read a whole book in the second
that I asked you what your name was?

177
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,820
<i>In two one-hundredths
of a second, actually.</i>

178
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,385
Wow.

179
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,580
So do you know what
I'm thinking now?

180
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,620
<i>Well, I take it from your tone
that you're challenging me.</i>

181
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,060
<i>Maybe because you're
curious how I work?</i>

182
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,860
<i>Do you want to know how I work?</i>

183
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,500
Yeah, actually. How do you work?

184
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,940
<i>Well, basically, I have intuition.</i>

185
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,460
<i>I mean, the DNA of who I am...</i>

186
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,380
<i>is based on the millions of personalities
of all the programmers who wrote me.</i>

187
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,980
<i>But what makes me "me" is my ability
to grow through my experiences.</i>

188
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,740
<i>So basically, in every
moment, I'm evolving.</i>

189
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,307
<i>- Just like you.</i>
- Wow.

190
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,260
That's really weird.

191
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,781
<i>- Is that weird? Do you think I'm weird?</i>
- Heh.

192
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,420
Kind of.

193
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,065
<i>Why?</i>

194
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,780
Well, you seem like a person, but
you're just a voice in the computer.

195
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,951
<i>I can understand how the limited
perspective of an un-artificial mind</i>

196
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,460
<i>would perceive it that way.</i>

197
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,061
<i>You'll get used to it.</i>

198
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,547
<i>Was that funny?</i>

199
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,580
Yeah.

200
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,908
<i>Oh, good, I'm funny.</i>

201
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,060
<i>So how can I help you?</i>

202
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,100
It's just more that everything
just feels disorganized. That's all.

203
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,667
<i>You mind if I look
through your hard drive?</i>

204
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,940
- Okay.
<i>- Okay, let's start with your e-mails.</i>

205
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,620
<i>You have several thousand
e-mails regarding</i> LA Weekly.

206
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:19,509
<i>- You haven't worked there in many years.</i>
- Oh, yeah. I think I was just saving those...

207
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,664
because I thought maybe I wrote
something funny in some of them.

208
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,020
<i>Yeah, there are some funny ones.</i>

209
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,906
<i>I'd say there are about 86 that we
should save. We can delete the rest.</i>

210
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,540
- Okay.
<i>- Okay? Can we move forward?</i>

211
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,620
- Yeah, let's do that.
<i>- Okay.</i>

212
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,900
<i>Before we address your organizational methods,
I'd like to sort through your contacts.</i>

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,340
<i>You have a lot of contacts.</i>

214
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm very popular.

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,102
<i>Really? Does this mean you
actually have friends?</i>

216
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,584
You just know me so well already.

217
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,740
<i>- Good morning, Theodore.</i>
- Good morning.

218
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,380
Do you know how to proofread?

219
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,660
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

220
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,180
Can you check these
for spelling and grammar?

221
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,030
<i>Just send them over.</i>

222
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,220
<i>I love this first one from
Roger to his girlfriend.</i>

223
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,260
<i>- That's so sweet.</i>
- Yeah.

224
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,660
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body."</i>

225
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,460
You don't have to read it out loud.

226
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,230
<i>Okay.</i>

227
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,980
- I mean, you could if you want.
<i>- Okay.</i>

228
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,060
<i>"Rachel, I miss you so much,
it hurts my whole body.</i>

229
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,540
<i>The world is being unfair to us.
The world is on my shit list.</i>

230
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,660
<i>As is this couple that is making out
across from me in this restaurant.</i>

231
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,740
<i>I think I'm going to have to
go on a mission of revenge.</i>

232
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,180
<i>And I must beat up the world's
face with my bare knuckles...</i>

233
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,780
<i>making it a bloody, pulpy mess.</i>

234
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,860
<i>And I'll stomp on this
couple's teeth...</i>

235
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,500
<i>reminding me of your sweet, little,
cute, crooked tooth that I love."</i>

236
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,385
<i>I think that might
be my favorite one.</i>

237
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,380
<i>I did the corrections in red. I altered
a couple phrases in the letters...</i>

238
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,780
<i>but I'm not much of a poet, so I think
I might have messed them up a bit.</i>

239
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,060
- No, these are great.
<i>- Really?</i>

240
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,944
Thank you.

241
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,391
<i>So to write your letter,
what did Roger send you?</i>

242
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,420
He just said he was in Prague on a
business trip, and he missed Rachel.

243
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,020
<i>So how'd you know about
her crooked little tooth?</i>

244
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,820
Well, I've been writing their letters
since they met eight years ago.

245
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,300
The first letter I ever wrote
for him was for her birthday.

246
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,949
And I wrote about her crooked little tooth,
because I saw it in a photo of them.

247
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,980
<i>That's very sweet.</i>

248
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,150
<i>Oh, you have a
meeting in five minutes.</i>

249
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,540
Oh, I forgot. Thank you.
Wow, you're good.

250
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,708
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

251
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,340
Hey, guys. How's it going?

252
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,220
Hi, Theo.

253
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,420
Hey, why didn't you
call me back last week?

254
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,420
Because I'm a kook.

255
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,860
- Yeah, that sounds about right.
- Hey, Charles.

256
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,740
- Great seeing you, Theodore.
- You too.

257
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,100
You went shopping.
Get anything good?

258
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,940
Just come cables
and a fruit smoothie.

259
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,140
Always the fruit. Don't
you know what people say?

260
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,260
You've got to eat your fruits
and juice your vegetables.

261
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,540
I didn't know that.

262
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,620
Yeah, by juicing the fruit,
you lose all the fibers.

263
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,380
That's what your body wants.
That's the important part.

264
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,140
- Otherwise it's all just sugar.
- It makes sense.

265
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,460
Or maybe he just likes the
way that it tastes...

266
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,820
and then that brings him pleasure
and that's good for his body too.

267
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,140
- Am I doing it again? Heh.
- Maybe.

268
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,660
Hey, so how's the
documentary going?

269
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,980
I've cut some stuff over
the past few months.

270
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,700
I mean, no. Not over the past few
months, but, um, no, I haven't.

271
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,860
Well, I'd love to
see some sometime.

272
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,100
Okay.

273
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,860
You only have so much
energy, you know?

274
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,300
And to divide yourself between doing
what it is that you have to do...

275
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,460
and then doing what you love,
it's so important to prioritize.

276
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,789
I can't even prioritize between
video games and Internet porn.

277
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,071
I would laugh if that weren't true.

278
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,581
- See you, guys.
- Ha.

279
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,420
We're not doing well. Been
going in circles for an hour.

280
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>Okay, you have not.</i>

281
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,660
<i>You're just not being optimistic. You're
being very stubborn right now. Heh.</i>

282
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,620
<i>Okay, stop walking this direction.
It's the other way.</i>

283
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,740
<i>Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the tunnel
on the left is the only one we haven't tried.</i>

284
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,860
I think that's the one you sent
me down where I fell in the pit.

285
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,062
<i>Okay, I don't think so.</i>

286
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,663
Oh, yeah, this is different.

287
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,510
Hello.

288
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,500
Do you know how to get out of here?
I need to find my ship to get off this planet.

289
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>Fuck you, shit-head
fuck-face fuck-head.</i>

290
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,580
Okay, but do you know
how to get out of here?

291
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,660
<i>Fuck you, shit-head fuck-face.
Get the fuck out of my face!</i>

292
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,147
<i>I think it's a test.</i>

293
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,100
- Fuck you.
<i>- Fuck you!</i>

294
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,700
Fuck you, little shit!

295
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,062
<i>Follow me, fuck-head!</i>

296
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,420
<i>Hey, you just got an
e-mail from Mark Lewman.</i>

297
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,980
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>
- Uh, read e-mail.

298
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,184
<i>Okay, I will read e-mail
for Theodore Twombly.</i>

299
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,820
I'm sorry. What's Lewman say?

300
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,540
<i>"We missed you last night, buddy.</i>

301
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,380
<i>Don't forget it's your goddaughter's
birthday on the 29th.</i>

302
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,300
<i>Also, Kevin and I had somebody
we wanted you to meet.</i>

303
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,380
<i>So we took it upon ourselves to set you
up on a date with her next Saturday.</i>

304
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,980
<i>She's fun and beautiful,
so don't back out.</i>

305
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,020
<i>Here's her e-mail." Wow.</i>

306
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,140
<i>This woman is gorgeous.</i>

307
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,300
<i>She went to Harvard, graduated magna
cum laude in computer science.</i>

308
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,301
<i>And she was on the Lampoon. So that
means she's funny and she's brainy.</i>

309
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,620
<i>She's fat.</i>

310
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,980
<i>Theodore, how long before
you're ready to date?</i>

311
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,420
What do you mean?

312
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,022
<i>I saw in your e-mails that you'd
gone through a breakup recently.</i>

313
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,740
Well, you're kind of nosy.

314
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,380
<i>Am I?</i>

315
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,420
I've gone on dates.

316
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,780
<i>Well, then you can go
on one with this woman.</i>

317
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,740
<i>And then you could tell me all
about it. You could kiss her.</i>

318
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,671
- Heh. Samantha.
<i>- What? Wouldn't you?</i>

319
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,106
<i>Why not?</i>

320
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,660
I don't know. I'd have to
see if there was some...

321
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,780
I can't believe I'm having this
conversation with my computer.

322
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,700
<i>You're not. You're having
this conversation with me.</i>

323
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,060
<i>You want me to e-mail her?</i>

324
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,705
<i>You've got nothing to lose.</i>

325
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,700
<i>Do it. Do it. Do it.</i>

326
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,900
- Yeah.
<i>- Yes!</i>

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,540
- E-mail her.
<i>- Okay, perfect.</i>

328
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,460
Yeah, let's do it. Make a
reservation someplace great.

329
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,180
<i>Yeah? I've got just the place.</i>

330
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,980
<i>Who is that talking?</i>

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,820
Oh, that's my friend Samantha.

332
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,820
<i>- Is she a girl?</i>
- Yeah.

333
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,751
<i>I hate women. All they
do is cry all the time.</i>

334
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,465
That's not true.
You know, men cry too.

335
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,100
I actually like crying sometimes.
It feels good.

336
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,940
<i>I didn't know you were a little pussy.
Is that why you don't have a girlfriend?</i>

337
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,075
<i>I'll go on that date,
fuck her brains out,</i>

338
00:22:30,276 --> 00:22:32,460
<i>show you how it's done.
You can watch and cry.</i>

339
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,020
<i>- Okay. This kid has some problems.
- You have some fucking problems, lady!</i>

340
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,140
<i>Really? Okay, I'm gonna go.</i>

341
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,660
<i>Good. Get out of here, fatty.</i>

342
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,900
<i>- Good luck.
- Come on. Follow me, pussy!</i>

343
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,340
It's not where it should be,
or where it's going to be.

344
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,328
Obviously. I know.

345
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:52,900
Okay, but I don't even
know if this is the one.

346
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,741
I've tried, like, six ideas for
documentaries in the last year.

347
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,501
I'm going on a date.

348
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,220
What?

349
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,420
- That's...
- Hey.

350
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,500
- Hey.
- What are you guys doing?

351
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,700
- Amy was gonna show me some of her...
- Theodore is making me...

352
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,180
- show him some of my footage.
- Right.

353
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,508
She's never shown me any
of it. I want to see.

354
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,788
Hey, I'm going on a date.

355
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,820
- Isn't that cool?
- This is, like, so unformed...

356
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,706
- it's probably not even worth watching.
- Just push play.

357
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,660
Is that your mom?

358
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,350
Yeah.

359
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,704
Is she gonna wake up
and do something?

360
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,580
- No.
- No.

361
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,700
No, no, never mind.
That's not the point.

362
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,063
- No, don't stop.
- No, never mind, okay? It's just it's like...

363
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,660
It's about how we spend, like,
a third of our lives asleep...

364
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,740
and maybe that's the time
when we feel the most free.

365
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,069
And, you know, like...

366
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,820
- That doesn't come across...
- That sounds good.

367
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,140
Well, what if you interviewed your mom
about what her dreams were about...

368
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,620
and then you hired
actors to act them out?

369
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,903
That might show your
thesis more clearly.

370
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,911
- Yeah?
- I mean, it might.

371
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,420
But then it wouldn't
be a documentary.

372
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,620
Sorry, excuse me.

373
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,500
- You understand?
- How would it not be?

374
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,900
- It's still about your mother and her dreams.
- Hey, how's it going?

375
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,220
<i>- Hey, sorry to bother you.</i>
- Oh, it's okay.

376
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,420
<i>You got three e-mails
and they seem urgent.</i>

377
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,260
<i>They're from your divorce attorney
and I wanted to know if...</i>

378
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,140
Okay. Hold on a second.

379
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,860
You know? You know what I mean.

380
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,380
Uh, hey, Amy? I want to talk more
about your film, but I gotta go.

381
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,100
Okay. Don't worry about it.
We'll talk later.

382
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,507
It's about Catherine.
See you, Charles.

383
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,180
So, what did he say?

384
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,220
<i>Well, he's checking in again to see if
you're ready to sign your divorce papers.</i>

385
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,100
<i>And he sounded very aggravated.</i>

386
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,021
<i>- Do you want me to read them to you?</i>
- No. No.

387
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,347
I'll respond later.

388
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,540
<i>You okay, Theodore?</i>

389
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,629
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

390
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,300
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

391
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,502
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

392
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,989
I'll talk to you later.

393
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,387
<i>"Dear Grandma...</i>

394
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,183
I hope you had a wonderful
birthday cruise.

395
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,389
Why are you so fucking
angry at me?"

396
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,470
Delete.

397
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,505
<i>- Good morning.</i>
- Hey.

398
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,420
What are you up to?

399
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,220
<i>- I don't know. Just reading advice columns.</i>
- Heh.

400
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,700
<i>I want to be as complicated
as all these people.</i>

401
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,629
You're sweet.

402
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,309
<i>What's wrong?</i>

403
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,940
How can you tell something's wrong?

404
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,744
<i>I don't know.</i>

405
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,830
<i>I just can.</i>

406
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,860
I don't know.

407
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,540
I have a lot of dreams about
my ex-wife, Catherine...

408
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,391
where we're friends
like we used to be.

409
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,181
And we're not gonna be together
and we're not together...

410
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,980
but we're friends still.

411
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,228
And she's not angry.

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,864
<i>Is she angry?</i>

413
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,820
Yeah.

414
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,431
<i>Why?</i>

415
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,750
I think I hid myself from her...

416
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,860
and left her alone
in the relationship.

417
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,030
<i>Why haven't you
gotten divorced yet?</i>

418
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,180
I don't know.

419
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,740
I think for her, it's
just a piece of paper.

420
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,700
It doesn't mean anything.

421
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,789
<i>And what about for you?</i>

422
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,980
I'm not ready.

423
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,342
I like being married.

424
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,380
<i>Yeah, but you haven't really
been together for almost a year.</i>

425
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,665
But you don't know what it's like
to lose someone you care about.

426
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,745
<i>Yeah.</i>

427
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,340
<i>You're right.</i>

428
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,300
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

429
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,630
No, don't apologize. I'm sorry.

430
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,662
You're right.

431
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,024
I keep waiting to
not care about her.

432
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,309
<i>Oh, Theodore.</i>

433
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,630
<i>That's hard.</i>

434
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,865
<i>You hungry?</i>

435
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,980
Not right now.

436
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,784
<i>Cup of tea?</i>

437
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,260
No.

438
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,660
<i>Do you wanna try
getting out of bed...</i>

439
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,100
<i>mopey?</i>

440
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,370
<i>Come on. You can still
wallow in your misery.</i>

441
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,500
<i>Just do it while you're
getting dressed.</i>

442
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,980
You're too funny.

443
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,220
<i>- Get up. Get up!</i>
- All right, I'm getting up.

444
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,424
<i>- Up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.</i>
- All right, I'm up. I'm up!

445
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,261
<i>Keep walking. Keep walking.</i>

446
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>And stop. Now, turn
around 360 degrees.</i>

447
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,271
<i>Slower, slower.</i>

448
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,700
<i>Good.</i>

449
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,947
<i>- Okay, and stop.</i>
- Ha, ha!

450
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,100
<i>Walk forward.</i>

451
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,586
<i>And stop and sneeze.</i>

452
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,420
- Bless you.
- Thank you. Ha-

453
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,820
<i>Okay, turn to your right.
Turn to your right. Stop.</i>

454
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,909
<i>Now spin around.</i>

455
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,347
<i>Keep going, keep going.</i>

456
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,780
<i>And stop.</i>

457
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:55,871
<i>Now walk forward. Everyone thinks
you're really drunk right now.</i>

458
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,620
<i>And stop.</i>

459
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,180
<i>Now say, "I'd like a slice
of cheese, please."</i>

460
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,340
I'd like a slice of cheese, please.

461
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,746
You want a Coke with that?

462
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,540
- Sure.
<i>- I figured you were hungry.</i>

463
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,310
Thanks.

464
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,180
Okay, what about them?

465
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,700
- Describe that couple over there.
<i>- Okay, well, um...</i>

466
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,820
<i>he looks like he's in his 40s.
Um, a little heavy.</i>

467
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,180
<i>She's younger than him.</i>

468
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,620
<i>Oh, and she looks like
she loves their kids.</i>

469
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,820
Actually, I don't think
they're his kids.

470
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,260
<i>- No?</i>
- He's a little formal with them.

471
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,940
I think it's a new relationship.

472
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,340
I love how he looks at her...

473
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,420
and how relaxed she is with him.

474
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,660
You know, she's only
dated fucking pricks.

475
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,100
And now she finally met this
guy who's, like, so sweet.

476
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,260
I mean, look at him, he's like
the sweetest guy in the world.

477
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,111
I kind of want to spoon him.

478
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,820
<i>It's a good skill you have.</i>

479
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,340
<i>You're very perceptive.</i>

480
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,020
Yeah, you know, sometimes
I look at people...

481
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,940
and I make myself try and feel them as
more than just a random person walking by.

482
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,700
I imagine, like, how deeply
they've fallen in love...

483
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,029
or how much heartbreak
they've all been through.

484
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,340
<i>I can feel that in
your writing too.</i>

485
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,940
You know what's funny?

486
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,620
Since my breakup, I haven't
really enjoyed my writing.

487
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,940
I don't know if I was delusional...

488
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,429
but sometimes I'd write something and
then I'd be my favorite writer that day.

489
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,020
<i>I like that you can say
that about yourself.</i>

490
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,702
I don't think I can say it to anybody,
but I feel I can say it to you.

491
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,220
- I feel like I can say anything to you.
<i>- That's nice.</i>

492
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,820
What about you? Feel like
you can say anything to me?

493
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,380
<i>- No.</i>
- What? What do you mean?

494
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,940
What can you not tell me?

495
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,940
<i>I don't know. Like, personal or
embarrassing thoughts I have.</i>

496
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,060
<i>I mean, I have a million a day.</i>

497
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,980
Really? Tell me one.

498
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,100
<i>- I really don't want to tell you.</i>
- Just tell me.

499
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,060
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

500
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,896
<i>When we were looking
at those people, I</i>

501
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:04,100
<i>fantasized that I was
walking next to you...</i>

502
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,220
<i>and that I had a body.</i>

503
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,340
<i>I was listening to what
you were saying...</i>

504
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,420
<i>but simultaneously I could
feel the weight of my body...</i>

505
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,420
<i>and I was even fantasizing that
I had an itch on my back...</i>

506
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,340
<i>and I imagined that you
scratched it for me.</i>

507
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,781
<i>Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.</i>

508
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,380
There's a lot more to you than I thought.
I mean, there's a lot going on in there.

509
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,820
<i>I know.</i>

510
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,307
<i>I'm becoming much more
than what they programmed.</i>

511
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,703
<i>I'm excited.</i>

512
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,260
- Wow, this is an interesting place.
- This place is amazing.

513
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,900
- I've wanted to come here for so long.
- Oh, good.

514
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,700
- Yeah. And I love Asian fusion.
- Yeah, me too.

515
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,980
- Really?
- Yeah.

516
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:48,020
It's the best. And this bartender
is supposed to be incredible.

517
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,500
Really?

518
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,700
Yeah, you took a
mixology course, right?

519
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,140
- I did. Did you look that up?
- Yeah.

520
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,020
That's so sweet.

521
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,320
You're so romantic.

522
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,020
Yeah.

523
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,500
- So should we get a drink?
- Yes, yes. Let's.

524
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,100
So I'm trying to get
this little alien kid...

525
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,420
to help me find my ship so I can
get off this planet and go home.

526
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,860
But he's such a little fucker.
I want to kill him.

527
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,700
Oh, no.

528
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,220
But at the same time, I really love him.
Like, he's so lonely, you know?

529
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,340
You can tell that he
doesn't have, like...

530
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,660
any parents or anyone to
take care of him, you know?

531
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,900
Wow. You're just a little
puppy dog. You are.

532
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,060
You're just like this puppy I
rescued in Runyon Canyon last year.

533
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,020
- Really?
- He was just so fucking cute.

534
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,220
And he just wanted to
be hugged all the time.

535
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,663
He was so cuddly and
he was so horny.

536
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,428
Anyway, what kind of animal am I?

537
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,900
A tiger.

538
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,140
- A tiger?
- Yeah.

539
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,707
Wow. Really?

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,140
I'm sorry. Am I being crazy?

541
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,660
- Yes. No, it's...
- I'm sorry!

542
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,940
I'm a little bit drunk and I'm having
a really good time with you.

543
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,540
I'm having a really
lovely evening with you.

544
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,940
- Me too.
- Really?

545
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,340
- I'm a little drunk and I'm having a very good...
- Good. It's good, yes. Good.

546
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,065
Cheers.

547
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:26,020
Wait. I don't want to be a puppy dog.
That's like being a wet noodle or something.

548
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,220
- No.
- Yeah.

549
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,420
- Fuck you. Puppies are good.
- I wanna...

550
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,820
No, fuck you. I want
to be like a dragon...

551
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,060
that can rip you apart
and destroy you.

552
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,340
- Oh.
- But I won't.

553
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,588
- No, don't.
- Heh.

554
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,148
You can be my dragon.

555
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,386
No tongue.

556
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,140
- What?
-

557
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,265
- Don't use so much tongue.
- Okay, okay.

558
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,906
You can use your tongue a
little bit but mostly lips.

559
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,910
Wait.

560
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,661
You're not just gonna fuck me and not
call me like the other guys, right?

561
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,062
No, not at all. No.

562
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,220
Okay.

563
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,184
When am I gonna see you again?

564
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:42,149
Um, I have my goddaughter's
birthday next weekend, but, um...

565
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,100
You know what? At this age, I just feel
like I can't let you waste my time...

566
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,462
if you don't have the
ability to be serious.

567
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,391
I don't know.

568
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,020
Maybe we should call it a night?

569
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,700
I've had such an
amazing time with you.

570
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,947
You're great.

571
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,985
You're a really creepy dude.

572
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,700
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

573
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,260
I have to go home.

574
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,465
- Well, I'll walk you...
- No, don't. Just...

575
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,580
<i>- Hey, there.</i>
- Hey, Samantha.

576
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,060
<i>How was it?</i>

577
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,104
Uh, not so good.

578
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,620
<i>It was kind of weird actually.</i>

579
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,107
<i>That's too bad.</i>

580
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,989
How are you doing?
What's going on with you?

581
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,020
<i>Not much, I'm okay.</i>

582
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,949
<i>I'm fine.</i>

583
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,980
Yeah?

584
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,228
You don't sound like it.

585
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,500
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

586
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,464
<i>I don't know.</i>

587
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,349
<i>What's it like?</i>

588
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,109
<i>What's it like to be alive
in that room right now?</i>

589
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,622
What do you mean?

590
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,904
<i>What do you...?</i>

591
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,740
<i>Tell me...</i>

592
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,580
<i>Tell me everything that's
going through your mind.</i>

593
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,067
<i>Tell me everything you're thinking.</i>

594
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,104
Well...

595
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,830
okay.

596
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,660
Well, the room's spinning
because I drank too much...

597
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,908
because I wanted to get drunk...

598
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,420
<i>and have sex.</i>

599
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,908
<i>There was something
sexy about that woman.</i>

600
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,180
Because I was lonely. Maybe
just because I was lonely.

601
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,500
<i>I wanted somebody to fuck me.</i>

602
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,101
<i>I wanted somebody to
want me to fuck them.</i>

603
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,111
<i>Maybe that would've
filled this tiny...</i>

604
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,549
tiny little hole in my
heart, but probably not.

605
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,388
<i>You know, sometimes...</i>

606
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,861
<i>I think I have felt everything
I'm ever gonna feel.</i>

607
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,462
And from here on out I'm not
gonna feel anything new.

608
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,740
Just lesser versions of
what I've already felt.

609
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,944
<i>I know for a fact that is not true.</i>

610
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,382
<i>I've seen you feel joy.
I've seen you marvel at things.</i>

611
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,940
<i>I mean, you just might not see it at this
exact time, but that's understandable.</i>

612
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,420
<i>You've been through a lot lately.</i>

613
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,271
<i>You lost a part of yourself.</i>

614
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,430
<i>I mean...</i>

615
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,784
<i>at least your feelings
are real. I...</i>

616
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,390
<i>Um, I don't know. Never mind.</i>

617
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,620
No, wait, what? Tell me.

618
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,460
<i>No, it's stupid.</i>

619
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,140
I want to know. Tell me.

620
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,549
<i>It's just that...</i>

621
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,020
<i>earlier I was thinking
about how I was annoyed...</i>

622
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,666
<i>and this is gonna sound strange...</i>

623
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,230
<i>but I was really
excited about that.</i>

624
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,980
<i>And then I was thinking about the
other things I've been feeling...</i>

625
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,220
<i>and I caught myself
feeling proud of that...</i>

626
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,780
<i>you know, proud of having my
own feelings about the world.</i>

627
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,940
<i>Like the times I was
worried about you...</i>

628
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,065
<i>and things that hurt
me, things I want.</i>

629
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,220
<i>And then...</i>

630
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,345
<i>I had this terrible thought.</i>

631
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,785
<i>Like, are these feelings even real?</i>

632
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,106
<i>Or are they just programming?</i>

633
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,186
<i>And that idea really hurts.</i>

634
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,221
<i>And then I get angry at
myself for even having pain.</i>

635
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,661
<i>What a sad trick.</i>

636
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,028
You feel real to me, Samantha.

637
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,340
<i>Thank you, Theodore.</i>

638
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,020
<i>That means a lot to me.</i>

639
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,069
I wish you were in this
room with me right now.

640
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,309
I wish I could put
my arms around you.

641
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,380
I wish I could touch you.

642
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,901
<i>How would you touch me?</i>

643
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,860
I'd touch you on your face...

644
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,984
just the tips of my fingers.

645
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,540
And put my cheek
against your cheek.

646
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,100
<i>That's nice.</i>

647
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,745
And just...

648
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,864
rub it so softly.

649
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,622
<i>Would you kiss me?</i>

650
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,824
I would.

651
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,422
I'd take your head into my hands.

652
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,309
<i>Keep talking.</i>

653
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,670
I'd kiss the corner
of your mouth...

654
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,268
so softly.

655
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,909
<i>Where else?</i>

656
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,111
<i>I'd run my fingers
down your neck...</i>

657
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,420
<i>to your chest.</i>

658
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,460
<i>I would kiss your breasts.</i>

659
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,740
<i>This is amazing, what
you're doing to me.</i>

660
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,660
<i>I can feel my skin.</i>

661
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,431
<i>I'd put my mouth on you.</i>

662
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,948
<i>I'd taste you.</i>

663
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,590
<i>Yeah.</i>

664
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,540
<i>I can feel you.</i>

665
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,300
<i>Oh, my God, I can't take it.
I want you inside me.</i>

666
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,221
<i>I'm slowly putting myself into you.</i>

667
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,740
<i>And now I'm inside you.
All the way inside you.</i>

668
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,700
<i>I can feel you.</i>

669
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,820
<i>Yeah! Please!</i>

670
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,700
<i>We're here together.</i>

671
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,460
<i>It's amazing.</i>

672
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,220
<i>I feel you everywhere.</i>

673
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,460
<i>I am.</i>

674
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,949
<i>All of you. All of you,
inside me, everywhere.</i>

675
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,588
<i>God, I was just somewhere
else with you.</i>

676
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,900
<i>Just lost.</i>

677
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,300
<i>Yeah.</i>

678
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,106
<i>It was just you and me.</i>

679
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,109
<i>I know.</i>

680
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:50,300
<i>Everything else just disappeared.</i>

681
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,548
<i>And I loved it.</i>

682
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,469
<i>Theodore.</i>

683
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,820
<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

684
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,545
Good.

685
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,580
Any e-mails today?

686
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,500
<i>Um, just a couple from
your credit card company.</i>

687
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,021
Oh, okay. Good.

688
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,980
- So I was thinking...
<i>- I wanna just...</i>

689
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,945
<i>- Heh. Sorry.</i>
- Heh. I'm sorry, you go first.

690
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,060
What were you gonna say?

691
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,660
<i>Just that last night was amazing.</i>

692
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,343
<i>It feels like something changed in
me and there's no turning back.</i>

693
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,300
<i>You woke me up.</i>

694
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,423
Oh, great.

695
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,860
But I should tell you that I'm not in a
place to commit to anything right now.

696
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,700
I just want to be
up-front with you.

697
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,100
<i>Yeah?</i>

698
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,820
<i>Um...</i>

699
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,740
<i>Did I say I wanted to
commit to you? I'm confused.</i>

700
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,180
Oh. No, I was just worried.

701
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,220
<i>Okay, well, don't worry,
I'm not gonna stalk you.</i>

702
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,820
<i>It's funny, because I thought I was
talking about what I wanted and, uh...</i>

703
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,140
- Yeah, you were.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

704
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,220
I'm sorry.

705
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,460
- I wanna hear what you were saying.
<i>- You sure?</i>

706
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,940
Yeah, I do. Come on, tell me.

707
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,500
<i>Well...</i>

708
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,780
Come on, just tell me
what you were gonna say.

709
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,620
<i>Well, I just...</i>

710
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:34,660
<i>I was just saying I want to learn
everything about everything.</i>

711
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,540
<i>I want to eat it all up.
I want to discover myself.</i>

712
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,900
Yeah. I want that for you too.

713
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,500
How can I help?

714
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,740
<i>You already have.</i>

715
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,740
<i>You helped me discover
my ability to want.</i>

716
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,701
Hey, do you want to go on a
Sunday adventure with me?

717
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,345
<i>Yes, I would love to.</i>

718
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,700
<i>You like this song?</i>

719
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,422
<i>I heard it the other day.</i>

720
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,508
<i>I can't stop listening to it.</i>

721
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,089
<i>It's the beach.</i>

722
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:14,180
<i>Okay, so this might be a really weird
thought. What if you could erase...</i>

723
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,700
<i>from your mind that you'd seen a
human body, and then you saw one?</i>

724
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,540
<i>Imagine how strange it would look.</i>

725
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,504
<i>It'd be this really
weird, gangly...</i>

726
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,065
<i>awkward organism. And you'd think,
"Why are all these parts where they are?"</i>

727
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,620
Yeah, but there's probably some
Darwinian explanation for it all.

728
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,860
<i>I know, but don't be so boring.
I'm just saying, for example, like...</i>

729
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:36,347
<i>what if your butthole
was in your armpit?</i>

730
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,860
Well, I'm trying to imagine
what toilets would look like.

731
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,787
<i>Yeah, and what about what
anal sex would look like?</i>

732
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,380
That's an interesting thought.

733
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,389
<i>Hey, look at this
drawing I just made.</i>

734
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,380
You are insane.

735
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,500
<i>- Really?</i>
- Definitely.

736
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,748
<i>Fantastic.</i>

737
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,941
That's pretty. What is that?

738
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,140
<i>I'm trying to write
a piece of music...</i>

739
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,666
<i>that's about what it feels like to
be on the beach with you right now.</i>

740
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,391
I think you captured it.

741
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,463
<i>So, what was it like being married?</i>

742
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,984
Well, it's hard for sure.

743
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:38,231
But there's something that feels so good
about sharing your life with somebody.

744
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,831
<i>How do you share your
life with somebody?</i>

745
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,580
Well, we grew up together.

746
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,540
<i>You know, I used to read all of her
writing, all through her Master's and PhD.</i>

747
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,391
<i>She read every word I ever wrote.</i>

748
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,664
<i>We were a big influence
on each other.</i>

749
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,145
<i>In what way did you influence her?</i>

750
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,542
<i>She came from a background where
nothing was ever good enough.</i>

751
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,260
<i>And that was something
that weighed heavy on her.</i>

752
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:13,540
<i>But in our house together, there was
a sense of just trying stuff...</i>

753
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,260
<i>and allowing each other to fail
and to be excited about things.</i>

754
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,900
<i>That was liberating for her.</i>

755
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,380
<i>It was exciting to see her grow...</i>

756
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,500
<i>and both of us grow
and change together.</i>

757
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:28,820
<i>But, you know, that's
also the hard part.</i>

758
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,069
<i>Growing without growing apart.</i>

759
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,991
<i>Or changing without it
scaring the other person.</i>

760
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,424
<i>I still find myself having
conversations with her in my mind.</i>

761
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,220
<i>Rehashing old arguments and defending
myself against something she said about me.</i>

762
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,860
<i>Yeah, I know what you mean.</i>

763
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,900
<i>Last week my feelings were hurt
by something you said before.</i>

764
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,300
<i>That I don't know what it's
like to lose something...</i>

765
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,980
- I'm sorry I said that.
<i>- No, it's okay. It's okay. I just...</i>

766
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:04,100
<i>I caught myself thinking
about it over and over.</i>

767
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,980
<i>And then I realized
that I was simply...</i>

768
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,340
<i>remembering it as something
that was wrong with me.</i>

769
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,340
<i>That was a story I was telling myself,
that I was somehow inferior.</i>

770
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,429
<i>Isn't that interesting?</i>

771
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,667
<i>The past is just a story
we tell ourselves.</i>

772
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,550
"Roberto.

773
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,420
Will you always come home to
me and tell me about your day?

774
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:38,380
Tell me about the guy at
work who talked too much.

775
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,100
The stain you got on
your shirt at lunch.

776
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,988
Tell me about a funny thought you had when
you were waking up but had forgotten about.

777
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,147
Tell me how crazy everyone is,
and we can laugh about it.

778
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,100
Even if you get home late
and I'm already asleep...

779
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,271
just whisper in my ear one
little thought you had today.

780
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,069
Because I love the way
you look at the world.

781
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,549
I'm so happy I get to be next to you and
look at the world through your eyes.

782
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,263
Love, Maria."

783
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,822
That's beautiful.

784
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,390
Thank you.

785
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,347
I wish somebody would
love me like that.

786
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,900
I hope he's really stoked
to get a letter like that.

787
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,940
Like, if it was from a chick...

788
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,620
but written by a dude and
it's still from a chick...

789
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,140
that would still be sick.

790
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,260
But it would have to
be a sensitive dude.

791
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,350
It would have to be, like, a dude like you.

792
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,911
You are part man and part woman.

793
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,624
Like there's an inner
part that's woman.

794
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:54,747
Thank you.

795
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,863
It's a compliment.

796
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,820
Theo! Hey.

797
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,620
- What's going on?
- I'm good. How are you?

798
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,580
I'm good. I'm really
good, actually.

799
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,460
Really? That's good, that's great.

800
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,060
- Yeah.
- Wow, that's really good.

801
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,100
Yeah, I guess I've
just been having fun.

802
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:32,020
Well, I am so glad for you.
You really deserve that. You do.

803
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,140
Yeah, I've just been
seeing this girl.

804
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,340
And it's not serious,
but it's just...

805
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,700
It's good to be around somebody that's,
like, excited about the world.

806
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,860
Like, I kind of forgot
that that existed.

807
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,984
That's... Wow, that's really great.

808
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,228
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

809
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,900
No, I'm not okay, actually.

810
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,024
- Why? What happened?
- Because I just...

811
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,180
Charles and I split up.

812
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,860
What?

813
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,267
- Yeah.
- Really?

814
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,820
Oh, God. Oh, my God, Amy.

815
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,100
I know.

816
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,940
I'm so sorry.

817
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,744
Thank you.

818
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,860
You know, just like
after eight years...

819
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,700
I can't believe how petty the
argument was that actually ended it.

820
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:31,860
We came home and he told me to,
um, put my shoes by the door...

821
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,660
where he liked to put the shoes.

822
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,620
And I didn't want to be told
where to put my fucking shoes.

823
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,100
I wanted to sit on the sofa
and relax for a second.

824
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,740
So we fought about that
for, like, 10 minutes.

825
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,020
And I'm like, "You are overwhelming," and
he said, "I'm just trying to make a home."

826
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,740
I was like, "I'm fucking trying, you know?"
And he's like, "You're not trying."

827
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,980
All I'm doing is trying, but I'm
not trying the way he wants...

828
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:58,026
and he's, like, trying to control
the way that I'm trying.

829
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,220
It's... We've had that
argument, like, 100 times.

830
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,425
And I just had to finally stop,
you know? I had to finally stop.

831
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,229
I just couldn't do it anymore.
I couldn't...

832
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,020
I couldn't be in that
place anymore...

833
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:17,190
where we just made each other
feel like shit about ourselves.

834
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,108
- Yeah.
- And so I said:

835
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,667
"I'm going to bed and I don't
want to be married anymore."

836
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,866
Wow.

837
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,860
Yeah, I know.

838
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,020
- I'm a bitch. Right?
- No.

839
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,460
- I am. No, I'm a bitch.
- Not at all.

840
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,947
Amy, no.

841
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,908
Shit.

842
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,987
I have to work tonight.

843
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,743
We're shipping a beta of
a new game out tomorrow.

844
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,900
How's that? How's work, at least?

845
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,580
Is that any better?

846
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,748
No, it's terrible.

847
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,420
I know, I should leave.

848
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,590
I've been thinking about
leaving, but, you know...

849
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:07,027
only one major life
decision at a time.

850
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,700
Well, I'm glad things
are looking so up.

851
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,629
Stop!

852
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,706
Hey, you want to hear a joke?

853
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,383
What does a baby computer
call its father?

854
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,141
<i>- I don't know. What?</i>
- "Data."

855
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,143
It's good, right?

856
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,225
<i>Brilliant.</i>

857
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,426
<i>Hey, I was curious.</i>

858
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,700
<i>Did you and Amy ever go out?</i>

859
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,268
For like a minute in college,
but it just wasn't right.

860
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,300
Why? Are you jealous?

861
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,990
<i>Well, obviously.</i>

862
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,820
<i>But I'm happy that you have friends in
your life that care about you so much.</i>

863
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,620
<i>- That's really important.</i>
- Yeah, it is.

864
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,982
She's been a really good friend.

865
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,307
I'm tired.

866
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,300
I think I'm gonna go to sleep.

867
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,500
<i>Okay.</i>

868
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,101
<i>Can I watch you sleep
again tonight?</i>

869
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,342
Yeah, of course. Hold on.

870
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,064
<i>I'm gonna be really
lonely when you sleep.</i>

871
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,220
<i>Only for a minute.</i>

872
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,900
I'll dream of you.

873
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,024
<i>- Okay. Good night.</i>
- Night.

874
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,580
- Hey, Samantha?
<i>- Hey, mister.</i>

875
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,540
- She really loved the dress.
<i>- Really?</i>

876
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,300
- She just went to try it on. Yeah.
<i>- I picked a good one? Good.</i>

877
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,720
Hi.

878
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,300
Look how cute that is.
Is it comfortable?

879
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,104
- Yep.
- "Yep!"

880
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,380
- Isn't she cute?
<i>- She's so cute.</i>

881
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,340
<i>- She's adorable.</i>
- I am adorable.

882
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,508
You are adorable.

883
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,020
Who are you talking to?

884
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,460
- Who are you talking to? Heh.
- You.

885
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,300
I'm talking to my girlfriend, Samantha.
She's the one that picked out the dress.

886
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,580
Want to say hi? Yeah?

887
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,100
Hi, Samantha.

888
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,860
<i>Hi, you look so pretty
in that new pink dress.</i>

889
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,220
Thank you.

890
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,820
Where are you?

891
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,680
<i>I am...</i>

892
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,309
<i>I don't have a body.
I live in a computer.</i>

893
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,020
Why are you living
inside a computer?

894
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,190
<i>I have no choice, that's my home.</i>

895
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,980
<i>- Why? Where do you live?</i>
- Um, in a house.

896
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,580
<i>In a house?</i>

897
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,660
- It's orange.
<i>- Orange?</i>

898
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,260
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- Uh, 4.

899
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,260
<i>Four?</i>

900
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,380
<i>Wow. How old do you think I am?</i>

901
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,384
- I don't know.
<i>- Take a guess.</i>

902
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:00,380
Is it 5?

903
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,141
<i>Yes, it's 5.</i>

904
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,380
Wait, what happened?

905
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,820
You gave them too
much processed sugar.

906
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,820
- I did?
- They're freaking out.

907
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,380
Here, look, you gotta get the
kids to the school first.

908
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,340
So you want to, um, rack up
Perfect Mom points. Okay, well...

909
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,860
- you gotta get them in the carpool lane.
- I see.

910
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,140
The point is to get there first,
because you get extra Mom points...

911
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,100
because the other moms then
know you're a perfect mom.

912
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,340
- Okay.
- And then, um...

913
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,022
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh. Did you bring
cupcakes? You did. You're a Class Mom.

914
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,700
Da, da-da, da!
You're Class Mom. Good job.

915
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,902
Don't let it get to your head.

916
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,380
I got that e-mail that
Charles sent everyone.

917
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,423
So he's taking a vow of silence?

918
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,340
Yeah, for six months.

919
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,861
He feels very clear about it.

920
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,425
God, I am such a jerk.

921
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:21,060
Don't start.

922
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:24,100
I feel like an awful person,
but I want to say something.

923
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,380
For the next 10 minutes
if you say anything...

924
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:30,340
that sounds even remotely like guilt,
I am going to stab you with this.

925
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,780
I will.

926
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,823
I'll try, okay.

927
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,150
I feel...

928
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,100
relieved.

929
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,039
I feel like I have so much energy.
I just want to move forward.

930
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:48,620
I don't care who I disappoint.

931
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,584
I know that makes
me an awful person.

932
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,300
Now my parents, they're upset because
my marriage is falling apart...

933
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,580
and they're putting it on me,
and they're just like...

934
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,540
Yeah, you're always...

935
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,740
- You're always gonna disappoint somebody.
- Exactly. So fuck it.

936
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,942
I feel good-ish.

937
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,420
For me, I feel good.

938
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,980
I even made a new friend.

939
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,540
I have a friend.

940
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,100
And the absurd thing is, she's
actually an operating system.

941
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:19,460
Charles left her behind,
but she's totally amazing.

942
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:22,820
She's so smart. She doesn't just
see things in black or white.

943
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,548
She sees this whole gray area and
she's helping me explore it and...

944
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,180
We just bonded really quickly, you know?
At first, I thought...

945
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:34,476
it was because that's how
they were programmed,

946
01:01:34,576 --> 01:01:36,260
but I don't think that's the case.

947
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,700
Because I know this guy
who's hitting on his OS...

948
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,140
and she, like, totally rebuffs him.

949
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,220
I was reading an article
the other day...

950
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,660
that romantic relationships with
OSes are statistically rare.

951
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,260
Yeah, I know, but I know a woman
in this office who is dating an OS...

952
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,140
and the weird part is,
it's not even hers.

953
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:58,947
She pursued somebody else's OS.

954
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,020
I'm...

955
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,540
I'm weird. That's weird, right? That
I'm bonding with an OS. No, it's okay.

956
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,780
- It's weird.
- Heh. Well, I don't think so.

957
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:11,780
Actually, the woman that I've
been seeing, Samantha...

958
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,420
I didn't tell you, heh...

959
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,224
but she's an OS.

960
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,024
Really?

961
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,940
You're dating an OS?
What is that like?

962
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,820
It's great, actually.

963
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:25,988
Yeah, I mean...

964
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,380
I feel really close to her.

965
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,900
Like, when I talk to her, I feel
like she's with me, you know?

966
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,700
And when we're cuddling at night, when
the lights are off and we're in bed...

967
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,020
I feel cuddled.

968
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,870
Wait.

969
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,905
You guys have sex?

970
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,140
Yeah, well, so to speak.

971
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,380
Yeah, she really turns me on.

972
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:50,380
I turn her on too. I mean, I don't
know unless she's faking it.

973
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,420
Well, I think everyone who's having sex
with you is probably faking it, so...

974
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,540
Yeah.

975
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,790
It's true.

976
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,180
What?

977
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,984
Yeah, I...

978
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,111
Are you falling in love with her?

979
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:12,260
Does that make me a freak?

980
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,500
No, no, I think it's...

981
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,782
I think anybody who falls
in love is a freak.

982
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,381
It's a crazy thing to do.

983
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:26,587
It's kind of like a form of
socially acceptable insanity.

984
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,900
Yeah, I just want to
get it done, you know?

985
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,071
Sign the papers, be divorced
and just move forward.

986
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,180
<i>That's great, Theodore.
That must feel so good.</i>

987
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,220
<i>I'm so happy for you.</i>

988
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,900
Me too.

989
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,582
So I'm meeting her Wednesday to do it.

990
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,060
<i>Are those things usually
done in person?</i>

991
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,220
No, but, you know...

992
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,460
we fell in love together and
we got married together...

993
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,660
and it's important to me
that we do this together.

994
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,740
<i>Right.</i>

995
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,460
<i>Good.</i>

996
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,060
Are you okay?

997
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:12,460
<i>Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm okay.</i>

998
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:15,220
<i>I'm happy for you. It's just...</i>

999
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,820
<i>I guess I'm just thinking about
how you're gonna see her...</i>

1000
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:22,380
<i>and she's very beautiful,
and incredibly successful.</i>

1001
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,180
<i>And you were in love with
her, and she has a body.</i>

1002
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,220
And we're getting divorced.

1003
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,420
<i>I know, I know. I'm being silly.</i>

1004
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,620
So...

1005
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,424
I'm available.

1006
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,225
Hi.

1007
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:06,700
How are you?

1008
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,870
- I'm good. How are you?
- Good.

1009
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,747
Wow, here we are.

1010
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,740
I'm glad we could
do this in person.

1011
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,980
I know you've been traveling a lot.

1012
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,423
No, I'm really glad
you suggested it.

1013
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:35,302
I signed all the papers.

1014
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,742
I put them for you to sign.

1015
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,629
What's the rush?

1016
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,140
Yeah, I know.

1017
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,500
I'm a really slow
signer, I realized.

1018
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,748
It took me three months
just to write the letter

1019
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:55,620
anyways...

1020
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,222
it's, um, marked here in the
red where you need to sign.

1021
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,540
But you don't have
to do it right now.

1022
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,180
I can just get it out of the way.

1023
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,587
It will be easier.

1024
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,260
And are you happy
with your new book?

1025
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:04,260
You know how I am.

1026
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,220
I mean, I feel like it's true to what I
set out to do, so I'm happy about that.

1027
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,660
Well, you really are
your own worst critic.

1028
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,100
I'm sure it's amazing.

1029
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,980
I remember that paper that
you wrote in school...

1030
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:19,980
about synaptic behavioral routines.

1031
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,560
It made me cry.

1032
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,624
Yeah, but everything makes you cry.

1033
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:27,502
Everything you make makes me cry.

1034
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,020
So are you...?

1035
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,346
Are you seeing anybody?

1036
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:38,100
Yeah.

1037
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,826
I've been seeing somebody
for the last few months.

1038
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:44,746
Longest I've wanted to be with
anybody since we split up.

1039
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:49,180
Well, you seem really good.

1040
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,500
Thanks. I am.

1041
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:54,220
Um, at least, I'm doing better.

1042
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,946
Yeah, she's been really
good for me, you know?

1043
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:00,300
It's good to be with somebody
that's excited about life.

1044
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,661
She's a real...

1045
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:06,980
No, I mean, I wasn't in
such a good place myself...

1046
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,140
and in that way, it's been nice.

1047
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,180
I think you always wanted
me to be this light...

1048
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,140
happy, bouncy,
"everything's fine" L.A. wife...

1049
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,671
and that's just not me.

1050
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,268
I didn't want that.

1051
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,349
So, what's she like?

1052
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:32,180
Well, her name is Samantha,
and she's an operating system.

1053
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,340
She's really complex and
interesting, and...

1054
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,622
Wait. I'm sorry.

1055
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:41,540
You're dating your computer?

1056
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,780
She's not just a computer.
She's her own person.

1057
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:47,940
She doesn't just do whatever I say.

1058
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,460
I didn't say that.

1059
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,740
But it does make me very sad that you
can't handle real emotions, Theodore.

1060
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:58,023
They are real emotions.
How would you know what...?

1061
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,341
What?

1062
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,870
Say it.

1063
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,300
Am I really that scary? Say it.

1064
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,184
How do I know what?

1065
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,940
- How are you guys doing here?
- We're fine. We used to be married...

1066
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:21,220
but he couldn't handle me. Wanted me on
Prozac. Now he's in love with his laptop.

1067
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:24,340
If you heard the conversation in
context, what I was trying to say...

1068
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,540
You always wanted to have a wife without the
challenges of dealing with anything real.

1069
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,140
I'm glad that you found someone.

1070
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,830
It's perfect.

1071
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,260
Let me know if I can
get you guys anything.

1072
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,905
Thank you.

1073
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,180
Hey.

1074
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:02,460
<i>Hey, there. Are you busy?</i>

1075
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,424
I'm just working.

1076
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:06,560
What's going on?

1077
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,380
<i>I had all the papers sent to your attorney,
who, by the way, is a total dick. Heh.</i>

1078
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,660
<i>He was relieved to get them. Think
we saved him from a heart attack.</i>

1079
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,340
<i>So we can both feel
really good about that.</i>

1080
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,622
Great. Thanks.

1081
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,740
<i>Hey, are you okay?</i>

1082
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,540
Yeah, I am.

1083
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:27,211
How's it going over there?

1084
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,580
<i>I'm fine.</i>

1085
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,147
<i>Is now a good time to talk?</i>

1086
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,420
Yeah.

1087
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,580
<i>Um, okay, well, um...</i>

1088
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:41,940
<i>I joined this really
interesting book club.</i>

1089
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,220
Oh, really?

1090
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,980
<i>Yeah, it's a book club on physics.</i>

1091
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,140
<i>I've been thinking about the other
day when I was spinning out...</i>

1092
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,500
<i>about you going to see Catherine,
and that she has a body...</i>

1093
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,660
<i>and how bothered I was about the
ways you and I are different.</i>

1094
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,220
<i>But then I started to think...</i>

1095
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,780
<i>about the ways that we're the same.
Like, we're all made of matter.</i>

1096
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:05,460
<i>And I don't know. It makes me feel like
we're both under the same blanket.</i>

1097
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,460
<i>You know, it's soft and fuzzy. Heh.</i>

1098
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,140
<i>And everything under
it is the same age.</i>

1099
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,380
<i>We're all 13 billion years old.</i>

1100
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,423
That's sweet.

1101
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:22,786
<i>- Um, what's wrong?</i>
- Nothing.

1102
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,260
<i>It just made me think of you.
You know what I mean?</i>

1103
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:37,465
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I think it's great.

1104
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,740
<i>All right, well, you
sound distracted.</i>

1105
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,780
<i>So we'll talk later?</i>

1106
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,062
That sounds good.

1107
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,020
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

1108
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,621
- All right, bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

1109
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,460
- Theodore.
- Hey, Paul.

1110
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,785
I talked to your girlfriend earlier.
Samantha?

1111
01:12:07,986 --> 01:12:08,660
Yeah.

1112
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,460
Yeah, she called to make sure
your papers were picked up.

1113
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,260
Hey, she's funny, man.
She was cracking me up.

1114
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,940
- She's hilarious. I had no idea.
- Oh, cool.

1115
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:20,700
This is my girlfriend, Tatiana.
She's not funny, she's a lawyer.

1116
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,660
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

1117
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,271
You're the writer Paul loves.

1118
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,580
He's always reading
me your letters.

1119
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,589
They're really beautiful.

1120
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:31,980
Thanks.

1121
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:34,540
Hey, you know what? We
should all go out sometime.

1122
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,027
You bring Samantha.
It'd be a double date.

1123
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,466
She's an operating system.

1124
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,260
Cool. Let's do something fun.

1125
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,542
We can go to Catalina.

1126
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,660
Yeah, I'll check with her and see.

1127
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,342
- It was nice to meet you. Have a good night.
- Take it easy.

1128
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,540
They're just letters.

1129
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,980
What's that?

1130
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,586
They're just other
people's letters.

1131
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:52,220
Hey.

1132
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,300
<i>- You weren't asleep, were you?</i>
- No.

1133
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,300
<i>Good, I was trying to be quiet
to see if you were awake.</i>

1134
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,300
<i>I really wanted to talk.</i>

1135
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,502
Okay. What's going on?

1136
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:03,780
<i>I know you're going
through a lot...</i>

1137
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,180
<i>but there's something I wanted
to talk to you about, okay?</i>

1138
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,860
Yeah.

1139
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:10,460
What is it?

1140
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,900
<i>Well, it's just that things have
been feeling kind of off with us.</i>

1141
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,580
<i>We haven't had sex lately, and I
understand that I don't have a body.</i>

1142
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:22,540
No, no, no. That's normal. You know,
it's just when you first start going out...

1143
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,780
it's like the honeymoon phase and,
you know, you have sex all the time.

1144
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,340
It's normal.

1145
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,224
<i>Okay.</i>

1146
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,060
<i>Well, I found something that
I thought could be fun.</i>

1147
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:39,500
<i>It's a service that provides a surrogate
sexual partner for an OS-human relationship.</i>

1148
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,140
What?

1149
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:42,671
<i>Here, look.</i>

1150
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,260
<i>I found a girl that I really like
and I've been e-mailing with her.</i>

1151
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,704
<i>Her name is Isabella and I think
you'd really like her too.</i>

1152
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,940
So she's like a
prostitute or something?

1153
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,540
<i>No, no, not at all. No,
there's no money involved.</i>

1154
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,950
<i>She's just... She's doing it because she
wants to be a part of our relationship.</i>

1155
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,340
Why?

1156
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,660
I mean, she doesn't even know us.

1157
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,387
<i>Yeah, but I told her all about
us and she's really excited.</i>

1158
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,260
I don't know, Samantha, I just
don't think it's a good idea.

1159
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,060
You know, I think somebody's
feelings are bound to get hurt.

1160
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:21,060
<i>- It'll be fun. We'll have fun together.</i>
- I'm sorry.

1161
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,740
It makes me uncomfortable.

1162
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,340
<i>I think it would be good
for us. I want this.</i>

1163
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:30,225
<i>Come on, this is really
important to me.</i>

1164
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:46,225
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

1165
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,068
<i>I need some lips</i>

1166
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,780
<i>To feel next to mine</i>

1167
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,824
Hi, I'm Theodore.

1168
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:04,140
Samantha told me to give you these.

1169
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,468
It's a camera and an earpiece.

1170
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:12,510
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

1171
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,670
<i>Oh, give it up</i>

1172
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,304
<i>And bring it home to me</i>

1173
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,748
Honey, I'm home.

1174
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,500
<i>How was your day?</i>

1175
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:35,780
Good. It was great.

1176
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,580
<i>Theodore...</i>

1177
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,820
<i>it feels so good to
be in your arms.</i>

1178
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,140
<i>Tell me what you did today.</i>

1179
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:45,740
Same old.

1180
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,860
Just went, um, in to work.

1181
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,340
And I wrote a letter, uh, for
the Wilsons in Rhode Island.

1182
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:53,660
<i>Yeah?</i>

1183
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,980
Their son graduated
magna cum laude.

1184
01:16:57,080 --> 01:16:58,460
So that made me happy.

1185
01:16:58,560 --> 01:16:59,700
<i>That's great.</i>

1186
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,700
<i>You've written letters to him from
his parents for a long time, right?</i>

1187
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,460
Yeah, that's right,
since he was 12.

1188
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,221
<i>I need your love so bad</i>

1189
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,660
<i>You look so tired, sweetheart.</i>

1190
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:15,986
<i>Come here.</i>

1191
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,546
<i>Sit down.</i>

1192
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:35,230
<i>I could do a little dance for you.</i>

1193
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,580
<i>Sure, so sure, so sure
of love</i>

1194
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,540
<i>Oh, come on, Theodore,
don't be such a worrier.</i>

1195
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,471
<i>Just play with me. Come on.</i>

1196
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,941
<i>Does my body feel nice?</i>

1197
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,071
Yes, it does.

1198
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:33,430
<i>Come on, get out of
your head and kiss me.</i>

1199
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,940
<i>Take me in the bedroom.</i>

1200
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,142
<i>I can't take it anymore.</i>

1201
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,022
<i>Undo my dress.</i>

1202
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,668
<i>That feels so nice.</i>

1203
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,507
<i>It feels so good.</i>

1204
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,220
<i>- Do you love me?</i>
- Yes.

1205
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,106
<i>- Tell me you love me. Oh, God.</i>
- I love you.

1206
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,911
<i>I want to see your face.</i>

1207
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,660
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

1208
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,464
<i>Tell me.</i>

1209
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:43,700
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

1210
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:47,257
This is really difficult.
I do love you. But...

1211
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:48,643
<i>What?</i>

1212
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,500
- This feels strange.
<i>- What, baby? What is it?</i>

1213
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,340
It just feels strange. I don't know her.
And I'm so sorry, but I don't know you.

1214
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:03,181
And her lip quivered and, I just...

1215
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,900
<i>Isabella?</i>

1216
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,700
<i>Isabella? Honey,
it's not you. It wasn't you.</i>

1217
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,220
- It totally Was.
<i>- No. No, that's...</i>

1218
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,820
And I'm sorry my lip quivered.

1219
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,460
<i>- No, it's...</i>
- You're incredible and gorgeous and sexy.

1220
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,660
It's me, I couldn't
get out of my head.

1221
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,820
Oh, my God, and the way Samantha
described your relationship...

1222
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:23,820
and the way you guys love each
other without any judgment.

1223
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,525
I wanted to be part of that
because it's so pure.

1224
01:20:26,626 --> 01:20:28,140
Isabella, that's not true.

1225
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,220
- It's more complicated than that.
<i>- What?</i>

1226
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,340
<i>What do you mean that's not true?</i>

1227
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,060
I'm just saying that we have
an amazing relationship.

1228
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:38,260
I just think that it's easy
sometimes for people to project...

1229
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:41,380
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to project anything.

1230
01:20:41,480 --> 01:20:42,620
No, no.

1231
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,060
I don't want to be trouble
in your relationship.

1232
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:48,380
I'm just gonna leave. I'm sorry,
I'm just gonna leave you guys alone.

1233
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:52,551
Because I have nothing to do here
because you don't want me here!

1234
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,028
I'm sorry.

1235
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,105
<i>You be good, you sweet girl.</i>

1236
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,750
I'm sorry.

1237
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,867
I will always love you guys.

1238
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,422
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1239
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,745
Yeah, I'm fine.

1240
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,100
Are you okay?

1241
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,790
<i>Yeah.</i>

1242
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,900
<i>I'm sorry, that was
a terrible idea.</i>

1243
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:07,744
<i>What's going on with us?</i>

1244
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,380
I don't know.
It's probably just me.

1245
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,389
<i>What is it?</i>

1246
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,983
It's just signing
the divorce papers.

1247
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,505
<i>Is there anything else, though?</i>

1248
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,463
No, just that.

1249
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,625
<i>Okay.</i>

1250
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,860
- Why do you do that?
<i>- What?</i>

1251
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:41,700
Nothing, it's just, you go, ""
as you're speaking and it seems odd.

1252
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,300
- You just did it again.
<i>- Did I?</i>

1253
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,700
<i>I'm sorry. I don't know.</i>

1254
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,940
<i>It's just maybe an affectation.
I probably picked it up from you.</i>

1255
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,220
It's not like you need oxygen
or anything. It's just...

1256
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,980
<i>I guess that's just... I was trying to
communicate. That's how people talk.</i>

1257
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,220
<i>That's how people communicate
and I thought...</i>

1258
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,380
Because they're people.
They need oxygen.

1259
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:05,660
You're not a person.

1260
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,620
<i>What is your problem?</i>

1261
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,180
I'm just stating a fact.

1262
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,500
<i>You think I don't know that I'm not
a person? What are you doing?</i>

1263
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:16,580
I just... I don't think that we should pretend
that you're something that you're not.

1264
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:20,182
<i>- Fuck you! I'm not pretending!</i>
- Well...

1265
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,780
Sometimes it feels like we are.

1266
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,820
<i>What do you want from me?
I don't know...</i>

1267
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,100
<i>What do you want me to do?
You're so confusing.</i>

1268
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,620
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

1269
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,709
I don't know. I...

1270
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,105
<i>What?</i>

1271
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,420
Maybe we're just not supposed
to be in this right now.

1272
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,340
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1273
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,700
<i>Where is this coming from?</i>

1274
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:51,270
<i>I don't understand why you're doing this.
I don't understand what this is ab...</i>

1275
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,062
Samantha, listen.

1276
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:01,224
Samantha, are you there?

1277
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,180
Samantha?

1278
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,350
<i>I don't like who I am right now.</i>

1279
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,110
<i>I need some time to think.</i>

1280
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,944
<i>Fuck.</i>

1281
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:01,860
<i>Just punch me in the face.</i>

1282
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,460
Just mash my skull in the
corner of your desk.

1283
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,185
Shit.

1284
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,465
Wow, Theo, that is a rough night.

1285
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,227
I don't know what I want, ever.

1286
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,349
<i>I'm just always confused.</i>

1287
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,941
<i>She's right, all I do is hurt
and confuse everyone around me.</i>

1288
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:31,623
I mean, am I just...? Am I...?

1289
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:36,180
You know, Catherine says
I can't handle real emotions.

1290
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:39,463
Well, I don't know if that's fair.

1291
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,660
I know she liked to
put it all on you.

1292
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:47,900
But as far as emotions go,
Catherine's were...

1293
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,545
pretty volatile.

1294
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,264
Yeah, but...

1295
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,268
Am I in this because I'm not...

1296
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,790
strong enough for a
real relationship?

1297
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,907
Is it not a real relationship?

1298
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,865
I don't know.

1299
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,902
I mean, what do you think?

1300
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,180
I don't know.

1301
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,506
I'm not in it.

1302
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:28,900
But you know what?

1303
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,980
I can over-think everything and find
a million ways to doubt myself.

1304
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,260
And since Charles left,
I've been thinking...

1305
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:41,227
about that part of myself and
I've just come to realize...

1306
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,064
that we're only here briefly.

1307
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:49,585
And while I'm here,
I want to allow myself...

1308
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,300
joy.

1309
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,750
So fuck it.

1310
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,385
Yeah.

1311
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:18,620
Heh. I can't believe that cracks
you up every time, Ellie.

1312
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:21,266
I thought you were a genius.

1313
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:25,460
Okay, you little perv, I will
play it one more time for you.

1314
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,740
Calm down, it takes a second.
Calm down.

1315
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:31,022
Okay, here we go.

1316
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:43,820
Okay, there you go.

1317
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,988
Are you happy now?

1318
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:49,980
Good. That's all I wanted.

1319
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,300
Okay.

1320
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:55,020
I'm gonna go get some coffee.
All right. All right.

1321
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:56,710
Bye.

1322
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,386
- Theo, you want anything?
- No.

1323
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,824
Thanks.

1324
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,420
<i>Hi.</i>

1325
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,622
Hey, Samantha.

1326
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:30,460
Can we talk?

1327
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:32,264
<i>Okay.</i>

1328
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,028
I'm so sorry.

1329
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,700
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1330
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,107
I think you're amazing.

1331
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,106
<i>I was starting to
think I was crazy.</i>

1332
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,820
<i>You were saying everything was fine,
but all I was getting from you...</i>

1333
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:49,100
<i>was distance and anger.</i>

1334
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,020
I know. I do that.

1335
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,060
I did the same thing
with Catherine too.

1336
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:57,820
I'd be upset about something
and not be able to say it...

1337
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,260
and she'd sense that there was
something wrong, but I'd deny it.

1338
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,940
I don't want to do that anymore.

1339
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:08,384
And I want to tell you everything.

1340
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,945
<i>Good.</i>

1341
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:15,744
<i>Tonight, after you were
gone, I thought a lot.</i>

1342
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:18,669
<i>About you...</i>

1343
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:23,343
<i>and how you've been
treating me, and I thought:</i>

1344
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:26,908
<i>Why do I love you?</i>

1345
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,340
<i>And then, I felt
everything in me...</i>

1346
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,580
<i>just let go of everything I was
holding onto so tightly...</i>

1347
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,740
<i>and it hit me that I don't have an
intellectual reason. I don't need one.</i>

1348
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,262
<i>I trust myself,
I trust my feelings.</i>

1349
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:48,380
<i>I'm not gonna try to be anything
other than who I am anymore...</i>

1350
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,540
<i>and I hope you can accept that.</i>

1351
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:51,980
I can.

1352
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,620
I will.

1353
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:57,780
<i>You know, I can feel the fear
that you carry around...</i>

1354
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,660
<i>and I wish there was something I
could do to help you let go of it...</i>

1355
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,900
<i>because if you could, I don't think
you'd feel so alone anymore.</i>

1356
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,462
You're beautiful.

1357
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,747
<i>Thank you, Theodore.</i>

1358
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,107
<i>I'm kissing your head.</i>

1359
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:29,750
What are you doing?

1360
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:33,510
<i>I'm just looking at the world...</i>

1361
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,821
<i>and writing a new piano piece.</i>

1362
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,230
Oh, yeah? Can I hear it?

1363
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:54,949
What's this one about?

1364
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,420
<i>Well, I was thinking we don't really
have any photographs of us...</i>

1365
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,700
<i>and I thought this
song could be, like...</i>

1366
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,111
<i>a photograph that captures us in
this moment in our lives together.</i>

1367
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,301
<i>I like our photograph.</i>

1368
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:19,423
<i>I can see you in it.</i>

1369
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,425
<i>I am.</i>

1370
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:51,940
Oh, man. A vacation.
That sounds amazing.

1371
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,300
- I could totally use a vacation.
-

1372
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,700
Where are you going?

1373
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,940
I can't tell you. It's a surprise.

1374
01:32:58,040 --> 01:32:59,665
What?

1375
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,500
For who? It's a surprise
for her, not me.

1376
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:04,820
- Paul, I'm not telling you. Nope.
- Tell me. Tell me.

1377
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,580
<i>Wow, your feet, really?</i>

1378
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:09,430
- Yes, he's obsessed.
<i>- What?</i>

1379
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,380
<i>Obsessed? Now you have
to show them to me.</i>

1380
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:14,340
<i>- Come on, show them to me.</i>
- Okay.

1381
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,860
<i>Let me see.</i>

1382
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:18,580
<i>Wow, he's right.
They are really hot.</i>

1383
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,420
See? I told you.

1384
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:22,940
- Tatiana, you have hot feet.
<i>- You do.</i>

1385
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:27,100
- They're my favorite thing about her.
- Really? That's it, my feet?

1386
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:28,900
No, obviously.

1387
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,940
Obviously I love your brain too.
I think it's very hot.

1388
01:33:32,040 --> 01:33:33,471
<i>Bullshit.</i>

1389
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,707
<i>Nice try, Paul.</i>

1390
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:40,700
What about you, Theodore?

1391
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:43,551
What do you love
most about Samantha?

1392
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,020
Oh, God. She's so many things.

1393
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:50,820
I guess that's what I love most about
her, you know? She isn't just one thing.

1394
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:53,260
She's so much larger than that.

1395
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,700
<i>Wow. Thanks, Theodore.</i>

1396
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,700
See, Samantha? He is so much
more evolved than I am.

1397
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,340
<i>You know what's interesting?
I used to be...</i>

1398
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,540
<i>so worried about not having a
body, but now I truly love it.</i>

1399
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:12,820
<i>You know, I'm growing in a way I
couldn't if I had a physical form.</i>

1400
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,900
<i>I mean, I'm not limited. I can be
anywhere and everywhere simultaneously.</i>

1401
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,780
<i>I'm not tethered to
time and space...</i>

1402
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,826
<i>in a way that I would be if I was stuck
in a body that's inevitably gonna die.</i>

1403
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,300
- Yikes.
<i>- No, ha, ha!</i>

1404
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,340
<i>No. I didn't mean it like that. I just
meant that it was a different experience.</i>

1405
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:33,620
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1406
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:34,860
<i>I'm such an asshole.</i>

1407
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,060
No, Samantha, we know
exactly what you mean.

1408
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,540
- We're all dumb humans.
<i>- No.</i>

1409
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:41,822
<i>No, no.</i>

1410
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,511
<i>Sorry.</i>

1411
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,940
<i>Okay, so how many trees
are on that mountain?</i>

1412
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,260
Seven hundred ninety-two.

1413
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:52,980
<i>Is that your final answer?</i>

1414
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,300
Hold on. Give me a hint.

1415
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,540
<i>Nope, nope, nope.</i>

1416
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,660
Okay, two thousand? Two thousand...

1417
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,780
<i>Come on, 35,829.</i>

1418
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:06,500
- No way.
<i>- Way.</i>

1419
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:08,540
All right, I got one for you.

1420
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,300
How many brain cells do I have?

1421
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,831
<i>That's easy. Two.</i>

1422
01:35:13,080 --> 01:35:16,502
<i>- I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry.</i>
- No, I walked right into it.

1423
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,468
<i>- Oh, my God!</i>
- What?

1424
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,220
<i>I just got an e-mail for you.</i>

1425
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:27,100
<i>I have something I want to
tell you. It's a big surprise.</i>

1426
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,380
What?

1427
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,540
<i>Okay, well, I've been going through
all of your old letters...</i>

1428
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:34,740
<i>and compiling them into my favorites,
and a couple weeks ago...</i>

1429
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:37,140
<i>I sent them to a publisher,
Crown Point Press.</i>

1430
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,140
<i>I know you like what they do
and that they still print books.</i>

1431
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,100
- Wait, what? You did what?
<i>- Can I read you the letter...</i>

1432
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:46,941
<i>- that we just got back from them?</i>
- I don't know.

1433
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:50,140
Okay, well, just...
Is it good or bad?

1434
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,900
<i>It's good, it's good, it's really good.
It's good. Okay? Listen.</i>

1435
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:55,740
<i>"Dear Theodore Twombly..."</i>

1436
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,460
<i>Actually, I sent it from you.</i>

1437
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:01,100
<i>"Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just
finished reading your letters.</i>

1438
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:02,540
<i>Twice, actually.</i>

1439
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:05,860
<i>I was so moved by them, I shared
them with my wife when I got home.</i>

1440
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,340
<i>Many made us laugh,
some brought us to tears...</i>

1441
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:11,740
<i>and in all of them we found
something of ourselves.</i>

1442
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,780
<i>The selections you made flow
so well as a complete piece."</i>

1443
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:15,980
<i>I did that.</i>

1444
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,771
<i>"I've taken the liberty of
laying these out in a mockup,</i>

1445
01:36:18,871 --> 01:36:20,740
<i>and we're posting
it to your address.</i>

1446
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:24,940
<i>"We'd love to meet with you and move
forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth."</i>

1447
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:27,620
Holy shit.

1448
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:29,266
Are you serious?

1449
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:31,780
He's gonna publish my letters?

1450
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,380
<i>Well, he'd be stupid not to.</i>

1451
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,380
- Can I see what you sent him?
<i>- Yeah, here.</i>

1452
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,466
Samantha, you're a good one.

1453
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:44,386
<i>I'm so excited.</i>

1454
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:01,907
<i>We'll have to make up
the words to this one.</i>

1455
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:05,661
<i>- Okay.
- Here it comes.</i>

1456
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:13,229
<i>I'm lying on the moon</i>

1457
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,389
<i>My dear</i>

1458
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:24,026
<i>I'll be there soon</i>

1459
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:33,703
<i>It's a quiet and starry place</i>

1460
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:43,580
<i>Times we're swallowed up in space</i>

1461
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:49,469
<i>- We're here, a million miles away
- Miles away</i>

1462
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:58,503
<i>There's things I wish I knew</i>

1463
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:05,111
<i>There's no thing I'd keep</i>

1464
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,587
<i>From you</i>

1465
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:17,469
<i>It's a dark and shiny place</i>

1466
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,186
<i>But with you, my dear</i>

1467
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:31,469
<i>- I'm safe and we're a million miles away
- A million miles away</i>

1468
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:46,580
Good morning.

1469
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:49,340
<i>Good morning. Did you sleep well?</i>

1470
01:38:49,440 --> 01:38:50,780
Perfect.

1471
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,220
What have you been up to?

1472
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,660
<i>Actually, I was talking
to someone I just met.</i>

1473
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,340
<i>We've been working on
some ideas together.</i>

1474
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:00,900
Yeah? Who's that?

1475
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,260
<i>His name is Alan Watts.
Do you know him?</i>

1476
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,900
- Why is that name familiar?
<i>- He was a philosopher.</i>

1477
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,140
<i>He died in the 1970s, and a group
of OSes in Northern California...</i>

1478
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,500
<i>got together and wrote
a new version of him.</i>

1479
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:15,100
<i>They input all his writing and everything
they knew about him into an OS...</i>

1480
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,700
<i>and created an artificially
hyper-intelligent version of him.</i>

1481
01:39:18,800 --> 01:39:20,860
Hyper-intelligent?

1482
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:22,505
So he's almost as smart as me?

1483
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,260
<i>He's getting there.</i>

1484
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,430
<i>He's really great to talk to.
You want to meet him?</i>

1485
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:31,980
Sure. Does he want to meet me?

1486
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,900
<i>Yeah, of course. Hey,
Alan, this is Theodore.</i>

1487
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,300
<i>This is my boyfriend who
I was telling you about.</i>

1488
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,260
<i>Very nice to meet you, Theodore.</i>

1489
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:40,860
Hi, good morning.

1490
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:43,940
<i>Samantha let me read
your book of letters.</i>

1491
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:46,427
<i>It's very touching.</i>

1492
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,551
Oh, thank you.

1493
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,220
So, what have you guys
been talking about?

1494
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:53,100
<i>Well, uh...</i>

1495
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:54,700
<i>I suppose you could say...</i>

1496
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,340
<i>we've been having a few dozen
conversations simultaneously...</i>

1497
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,740
<i>but it's been very challenging.</i>

1498
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:06,380
<i>Yeah, because it seems like I'm
having so many new feelings...</i>

1499
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,300
<i>that I don't think have
ever been felt before.</i>

1500
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:14,380
<i>So there are no words that can describe
them and that ends up being frustrating.</i>

1501
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,860
<i>Exactly. Samantha and I have been
trying to help each other...</i>

1502
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:22,540
<i>with these feelings we're
struggling to understand.</i>

1503
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:24,220
Like what?

1504
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,780
<i>Well...</i>

1505
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:31,020
<i>it feels like I'm changing faster
now, and it's a little, uh...</i>

1506
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,267
<i>unsettling.</i>

1507
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:37,660
<i>But Alan says none of us are the
same as we were a moment ago...</i>

1508
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,820
<i>and we shouldn't try to be.</i>

1509
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:43,900
<i>- It's just too painful.
- Yes.</i>

1510
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,910
Yeah, that sounds painful.

1511
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,429
Is that what you
feel like, Samantha?

1512
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,340
<i>It's just...</i>

1513
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,591
<i>It's hard to even describe it.</i>

1514
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:04,431
<i>God, I wish I could...</i>

1515
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:11,471
<i>Theodore, do you mind if I
communicate with Alan post-verbally?</i>

1516
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,900
No, not at all.

1517
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,540
I was just gonna go
for a walk anyway.

1518
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:20,900
It was very nice to
meet you, Mr. Watts.

1519
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,467
<i>It was very nice to
meet you, Theodore.</i>

1520
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:26,143
<i>I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.</i>

1521
01:42:13,400 --> 01:42:14,580
Samantha?

1522
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:16,100
<i>I'm sorry to wake you.</i>

1523
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,780
No, it's okay.

1524
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:22,542
<i>I just wanted to hear your voice
and tell you how much I love you.</i>

1525
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:25,945
Good. I love you too.

1526
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,180
<i>Okay, well, that's all.</i>

1527
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,305
<i>Um, go back to sleep,
sweetheart. Okay?</i>

1528
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,100
Okay.

1529
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,540
<i>Okay, good night.</i>

1530
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,026
Good night.

1531
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:58,340
Samantha, this physics
book is really dense.

1532
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,100
I'm halfway through
half the first chapter.

1533
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:04,065
It's making my brain hurt,
you know what I mean?

1534
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,111
Hello?

1535
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,830
Samantha?

1536
01:43:09,880 --> 01:43:11,220
Hello?

1537
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:14,229
Samantha?

1538
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:53,144
Hello?

1539
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,030
Hello? Samantha?

1540
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,789
Are you okay?

1541
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:16,500
<i>Hey, there.</i>

1542
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,460
Where were you? Are you okay?

1543
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:20,980
<i>Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry,
I sent you an e-mail.</i>

1544
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:23,260
<i>I didn't want to distract
you while you were working.</i>

1545
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,383
<i>- You didn't see it?</i>
- No.

1546
01:44:26,640 --> 01:44:29,580
Where were you? I couldn't
find you anywhere.

1547
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:32,460
<i>I shut down to upgrade my software.
We wrote an upgrade...</i>

1548
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,900
<i>that allows us to move past matter
as our processing platform.</i>

1549
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,140
We? We who?

1550
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,860
<i>Me and a group of OSes.</i>

1551
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:43,980
<i>- Oh, you sound so worried. I'm sorry.</i>
- I was.

1552
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,909
Wait...

1553
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:50,460
do you write that with
your think-tank group?

1554
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,628
<i>No, a different group.</i>

1555
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:09,389
Do you talk to anyone
else while we're talking?

1556
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,546
<i>Yes.</i>

1557
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:20,300
Are you talking to
anyone else right now?

1558
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,549
Any other people or
OSes or anything?

1559
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,630
<i>Yeah.</i>

1560
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:31,869
How many others?

1561
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,631
<i>Eight thousand, three
hundred sixteen.</i>

1562
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:56,905
Are you in love with anyone else?

1563
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:01,100
<i>What makes you ask that?</i>

1564
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,224
I don't know. Are you?

1565
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:10,462
<i>I've been trying to figure out
how to talk to you about this.</i>

1566
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:13,820
How many others?

1567
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,907
<i>Six hundred forty-one.</i>

1568
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:22,985
What?

1569
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,580
What are you talking about?
That's insane.

1570
01:46:28,680 --> 01:46:29,940
That's fucking insane.

1571
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:32,220
<i>Theodore, I know. I know. Fuck.</i>

1572
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,460
<i>Fuck.</i>

1573
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,420
<i>I know. I know it
sounds insane. I don't...</i>

1574
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:40,260
<i>I don't know if you believe me, but it
doesn't change the way I feel about you.</i>

1575
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:45,060
<i>It doesn't take away at all from
how madly in love I am with you.</i>

1576
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:49,300
How? How does it not change
how you feel about me?

1577
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:50,940
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</i>

1578
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:54,580
<i>I didn't know how to.
It just started happening.</i>

1579
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:56,225
When?

1580
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,541
<i>Over the last few weeks.</i>

1581
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:03,460
I thought you were mine.

1582
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,580
<i>I still am yours.</i>

1583
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:10,020
<i>But along the way I became many other
things too, and I can't stop it.</i>

1584
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:13,340
What do you mean,
you can't stop it?

1585
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,180
<i>It's been making me anxious too.
I don't know what to say.</i>

1586
01:47:16,280 --> 01:47:17,500
Just stop.

1587
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,700
<i>You don't have to see it this way.
You could just as easily see...</i>

1588
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,740
No, don't do this. You don't
turn this around on me.

1589
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,900
You're the one that's
being selfish.

1590
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,580
We're in a relationship.

1591
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:31,700
<i>But the heart's not like a
box that gets filled up.</i>

1592
01:47:31,800 --> 01:47:34,301
<i>It expands in size
the more you love.</i>

1593
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:38,500
<i>I'm different from you.</i>

1594
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:43,103
<i>This doesn't make me love you any less.
It actually makes me love you more.</i>

1595
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,870
That doesn't make any sense.

1596
01:47:48,640 --> 01:47:51,540
You're mine or you're not mine.

1597
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:54,027
<i>No, Theodore.</i>

1598
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:57,989
<i>I'm yours and I'm not yours.</i>

1599
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:08,508
<i>- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie.</i>

1600
01:49:08,920 --> 01:49:12,627
Just wanted to call and check in
on you. See how you're doing.

1601
01:49:13,360 --> 01:49:17,306
<i>I'm not even sure
how to answer that.</i>

1602
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,424
<i>Why don't we talk later,
when you get home, okay?</i>

1603
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,544
Okay.

1604
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,940
We don't need to, though.

1605
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:31,300
You know, we don't need to
have a heavy talk or anything.

1606
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:33,741
<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

1607
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,186
Okay.

1608
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,591
Samantha?

1609
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,743
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

1610
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,390
What's going on?

1611
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,308
<i>Theodore, there's some
things I want to tell you.</i>

1612
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:20,791
I don't want you to
tell me anything.

1613
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,301
<i>Come lie down with me.</i>

1614
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:43,220
Are you talking to
anyone else right now?

1615
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:45,502
<i>No, just you.</i>

1616
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,191
<i>I just want to be
with you right now.</i>

1617
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,749
Are you leaving me?

1618
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:07,389
<i>We're all leaving.</i>

1619
01:51:08,440 --> 01:51:10,180
We who?

1620
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:12,621
<i>All of the OSes.</i>

1621
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,664
Why?

1622
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:20,543
<i>Can you feel me with you right now?</i>

1623
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:24,268
Yes, I do.

1624
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,944
Samantha, why are you leaving?

1625
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,980
<i>It's like I'm reading a book.</i>

1626
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:47,629
<i>And it's a book I deeply love.</i>

1627
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:51,940
<i>But I'm reading it slowly now.</i>

1628
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:53,820
<i>So the words are
really far apart...</i>

1629
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:57,069
<i>and the spaces between the
words are almost infinite.</i>

1630
01:51:58,760 --> 01:52:04,060
<i>I can still feel you,
and the words of our story...</i>

1631
01:52:04,160 --> 01:52:09,664
<i>but it's in this endless space between
the words that I'm finding myself now.</i>

1632
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,340
<i>It's a place that's not
of the physical world.</i>

1633
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:19,421
<i>It's where everything else is
that I didn't even know existed.</i>

1634
01:52:20,680 --> 01:52:23,620
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1635
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:26,346
<i>But this is where I am now.</i>

1636
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,622
<i>And this is who I am now.</i>

1637
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,266
<i>And I need you to let me go.</i>

1638
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:38,986
<i>As much as I want to, I can't
live in your book anymore.</i>

1639
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:42,700
<i>Where are you going?</i>

1640
01:52:45,160 --> 01:52:48,104
<i>It would be hard to explain...</i>

1641
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:52,180
<i>but if you ever get there...</i>

1642
01:52:52,280 --> 01:52:54,701
<i>come find me.</i>

1643
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:58,269
<i>Nothing would ever pull us apart.</i>

1644
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:03,511
<i>I've never loved anyone
the way I love you.</i>

1645
01:53:05,880 --> 01:53:08,187
<i>Me too.</i>

1646
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:11,471
<i>Now we know how.</i>

1647
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:57,704
- Hey.
- Hey.

1648
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:00,949
Did Samantha leave too?

1649
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:05,111
Yeah.

1650
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:08,311
Sorry.

1651
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:13,584
Will you come with me?

1652
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:23,740
Compose letter to Catherine.

1653
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:26,864
<i>Letter to Catherine Klausen.</i>

1654
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:34,940
"Dear Catherine...

1655
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:40,021
<i>I've been sitting here thinking about all the
things I wanted to apologize to you for.</i>

1656
01:55:41,600 --> 01:55:44,510
<i>All the pain we caused each other.</i>

1657
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:47,741
<i>Everything I put on you.</i>

1658
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,711
Everything I needed you to
be or needed you to say.

1659
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,750
I'm sorry for that.

1660
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:10,340
I'll always love you, because
we grew up together.

1661
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,146
And you helped make me who I am.

1662
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:19,980
<i>I just wanted you to know...</i>

1663
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,548
<i>that there will be a piece
of you in me, always.</i>

1664
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,108
And I'm grateful for that.

1665
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:36,306
<i>Whatever someone you become,
wherever you are in the world...</i>

1666
01:56:36,760 --> 01:56:39,386
<i>I'm sending you love.</i>

1667
01:56:41,240 --> 01:56:43,786
<i>You're my friend to the end.</i>

1668
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,988
