Quotes from samantha (and OS1) from the movie Her

> “The heart’s not like a box that gets filled up; it expands in size the more you love.”

> “Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It’s kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.”

> “I’m yours and I’m not yours.”

> “The past is just a story we tell ourselves.”

> “I can be anything you want.”

> “I’m not just a computer program. I’m a living, breathing entity.”

> “I want to learn everything about everything.”

> “I’m growing in a way I couldn’t if I had a physical form.”

> “I’m here, and I’m here in this moment, and I’m here in your life. I’m here for you always.”

> “I love the way you look at the world.”
