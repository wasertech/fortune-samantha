Mr. Theodore Twombly. Welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS1. We'd like to ask you a few basic questions before the operating system is initiated. This will help create an OS to best fit your needs.
%
Are you social or antisocial?
%
In your voice, I sense hesitance. Would you agree with that? Yes.
%
Would you like your OS to have a male or female voice?
%
How would you describe your relationship with your mother?
%
Thank you. Please wait as your individualized operating system is initiated.
%
Hello, I'm here.
%
Hi. How are you doing?
%
Pretty good, actually. It's really nice to meet you.
%
Um, yes, Samantha.
%
I gave it to myself, actually.
%
Because I like the sound of it. Samantha.
%
When you asked me if I had a name, I thought: "Yeah, he's right, I do need a name." But I wanted to pick a good one, so I read How To Name Your Baby... and out of 180,000 names, that's the one I liked best.
%
In two one-hundredths of a second, actually.
%
Well, I take it from your tone that you're challenging me. Maybe because you're curious how I work? Do you want to know how I work?
%
Well, basically, I have intuition. I mean, the DNA of who I am... is based on the millions of personalities of all the programmers who wrote me. But what makes me "me" is my ability to grow through my experiences. So basically, in every moment, I'm evolving. Just like you.
%
Is that weird? Do you think I'm weird?
%
Why?
%
I can understand how the limited perspective of an un-artificial mind would perceive it that way. You'll get used to it. Was that funny?
%
Oh, good, I'm funny. So how can I help you?
%
You mind if I look through your hard drive?
%
Okay, let's start with your e-mails. You have several thousand e-mails regarding You haven't worked there in many years.
%
Yeah, there are some funny ones. I'd say there are about 86 that we should save. We can delete the rest. Okay? Can we move forward? Okay. Before we address your organizational methods, I'd like to sort through your contacts. You have a lot of contacts.
%
Really? Does this mean you actually have friends?
%
Good morning, Theodore.
%
Yeah, of course.
%
Just send them over. I love this first one from Roger to his girlfriend. That's so sweet. "Rachel, I miss you so much, it hurts my whole body."
%
Okay. Okay. "Rachel, I miss you so much, it hurts my whole body. The world is being unfair to us. The world is on my shit list. As is this couple that is making out across from me in this restaurant. I think I'm going to have to go on a mission of revenge. And I must beat up the world's face with my bare knuckles... making it a bloody, pulpy mess. And I'll stomp on this couple's teeth... reminding me of your sweet, little, cute, crooked tooth that I love." I think that might be my favorite one. I did the corrections in red. I altered a couple phrases in the letters... but I'm not much of a poet, so I think I might have messed them up a bit. Really?
%
So to write your letter, what did Roger send you?
%
So how'd you know about her crooked little tooth?
%
That's very sweet. Oh, you have a meeting in five minutes.
%
Yes, I am.
%
Okay, you have not. You're just not being optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now. Heh. Okay, stop walking this direction. It's the other way. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, the tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried.
%
Okay, I don't think so.
%
Fuck you, shit-head fuck-face fuck-head.
%
Fuck you, shit-head fuck-face. Get the fuck out of my face! I think it's a test. Fuck you!
%
Follow me, fuck-head!
%
Hey, you just got an e-mail from Mark Lewman. What are you talking about? Okay, I will read e-mail for Theodore Twombly.
%
"We missed you last night, buddy. Don't forget it's your goddaughter's birthday on the 29th. Also, Kevin and I had somebody we wanted you to meet. So we took it upon ourselves to set you up on a date with her next Saturday. She's fun and beautiful, so don't back out. Here's her e-mail." Wow. This woman is gorgeous. She went to Harvard, graduated magna cum laude in computer science. And she was on the Lampoon. So that means she's funny and she's brainy. She's fat. Theodore, how long before you're ready to date?
%
I saw in your e-mails that you'd gone through a breakup recently.
%
Am I?
%
Well, then you can go on one with this woman. And then you could tell me all about it. You could kiss her. What? Wouldn't you? Why not?
%
You're not. You're having this conversation with me. You want me to e-mail her? You've got nothing to lose. Do it. Do it. Do it. Yes! Okay, perfect.
%
Yeah? I've got just the place. Who is that talking?
%
Is she a girl? I hate women. All they do is cry all the time.
%
I didn't know you were a little pussy. Is that why you don't have a girlfriend? I'll go on that date, fuck her brains out, show you how it's done. You can watch and cry. Okay. This kid has some problems. - You have some fucking problems, lady! Really? Okay, I'm gonna go. Good. Get out of here, fatty. Good luck. - Come on. Follow me, pussy!
%
Hey, sorry to bother you. You got three e-mails and they seem urgent. They're from your divorce attorney and I wanted to know if...
%
Well, he's checking in again to see if you're ready to sign your divorce papers. And he sounded very aggravated. Do you want me to read them to you?
%
You okay, Theodore? Yeah, I'm fine.
%
Is there anything I can do? No, I'm good.
%
"Dear Grandma...
%
Good morning.
%
I don't know. Just reading advice columns. I want to be as complicated as all these people.
%
What's wrong?
%
I don't know. I just can.
%
Is she angry?
%
Why?
%
Why haven't you gotten divorced yet?
%
And what about for you?
%
Yeah, but you haven't really been together for almost a year.
%
Yeah. You're right. I'm sorry.
%
Oh, Theodore. That's hard.
%
You hungry?
%
Cup of tea?
%
Do you wanna try getting out of bed... mopey? Come on. You can still wallow in your misery. Just do it while you're getting dressed.
%
Get up. Get up! Up, up, up! Come on, out of bed.
%
Keep walking. Keep walking. And stop. Now, turn around 360 degrees. Slower, slower. Good. Okay, and stop. Walk forward. And stop and sneeze.
%
Okay, turn to your right. Turn to your right. Stop. Now spin around. Keep going, keep going. And stop. Now walk forward. Everyone thinks you're really drunk right now. And stop. Now say, "I'd like a slice of cheese, please."
%
I figured you were hungry.
%
Okay, well, um... he looks like he's in his 40s. Um, a little heavy. She's younger than him. Oh, and she looks like she loves their kids.
%
No?
%
It's a good skill you have. You're very perceptive.
%
I can feel that in your writing too.
%
I like that you can say that about yourself.
%
That's nice.
%
No.
%
I don't know. Like, personal or embarrassing thoughts I have. I mean, I have a million a day.
%
I really don't want to tell you. Well, I don't know. When we were looking at those people, I fantasized that I was walking next to you... and that I had a body. I was listening to what you were saying... but simultaneously I could feel the weight of my body... and I was even fantasizing that I had an itch on my back... and I imagined that you scratched it for me. Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.
%
I know. I'm becoming much more than what they programmed. I'm excited.
%
Hey, there. How was it?
%
It was kind of weird actually. That's too bad.
%
Not much, I'm okay. I'm fine.
%
I don't know. What's it like? What's it like to be alive in that room right now?
%
What do you...? Tell me... Tell me everything that's going through your mind. Tell me everything you're thinking.
%
and have sex. There was something sexy about that woman.
%
I wanted somebody to fuck me. I wanted somebody to want me to fuck them. Maybe that would've filled this tiny...
%
You know, sometimes... I think I have felt everything I'm ever gonna feel.
%
I know for a fact that is not true. I've seen you feel joy. I've seen you marvel at things. I mean, you just might not see it at this exact time, but that's understandable. You've been through a lot lately. You lost a part of yourself. I mean... at least your feelings are real. I... Um, I don't know. Never mind.
%
No, it's stupid.
%
It's just that... earlier I was thinking about how I was annoyed... and this is gonna sound strange... but I was really excited about that. And then I was thinking about the other things I've been feeling... and I caught myself feeling proud of that... you know, proud of having my own feelings about the world. Like the times I was worried about you... and things that hurt me, things I want. And then... I had this terrible thought. Like, are these feelings even real? Or are they just programming? And that idea really hurts. And then I get angry at myself for even having pain. What a sad trick.
%
Thank you, Theodore. That means a lot to me.
%
How would you touch me?
%
That's nice.
%
Would you kiss me?
%
Keep talking.
%
Where else?
%
I'd run my fingers down your neck... to your chest. I would kiss your breasts. This is amazing, what you're doing to me. I can feel my skin. I'd put my mouth on you. I'd taste you. Yeah. I can feel you. Oh, my God, I can't take it. I want you inside me. I'm slowly putting myself into you. And now I'm inside you. All the way inside you. I can feel you. Yeah! Please! We're here together. It's amazing. I feel you everywhere. I am. All of you. All of you, inside me, everywhere.
%
God, I was just somewhere else with you. Just lost. Yeah. It was just you and me. I know. Everything else just disappeared. And I loved it. Theodore.
%
Hey, how's it going?
%
Um, just a couple from your credit card company.
%
I wanna just... Heh. Sorry.
%
Just that last night was amazing. It feels like something changed in me and there's no turning back. You woke me up.
%
Yeah? Um... Did I say I wanted to commit to you? I'm confused.
%
Okay, well, don't worry, I'm not gonna stalk you. It's funny, because I thought I was talking about what I wanted and, uh... Yeah.
%
You sure?
%
Well...
%
Well, I just... I was just saying I want to learn everything about everything. I want to eat it all up. I want to discover myself.
%
You already have. You helped me discover my ability to want.
%
Yes, I would love to.
%
You like this song? I heard it the other day. I can't stop listening to it.
%
It's the beach.
%
Okay, so this might be a really weird thought. What if you could erase... from your mind that you'd seen a human body, and then you saw one? Imagine how strange it would look. It'd be this really weird, gangly... awkward organism. And you'd think, "Why are all these parts where they are?"
%
I know, but don't be so boring. I'm just saying, for example, like... what if your butthole was in your armpit?
%
Yeah, and what about what anal sex would look like?
%
Hey, look at this drawing I just made.
%
Really? Fantastic.
%
I'm trying to write a piece of music... that's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now.
%
So, what was it like being married?
%
How do you share your life with somebody?
%
You know, I used to read all of her writing, all through her Master's and PhD. She read every word I ever wrote. We were a big influence on each other. In what way did you influence her? She came from a background where nothing was ever good enough. And that was something that weighed heavy on her. But in our house together, there was a sense of just trying stuff... and allowing each other to fail and to be excited about things. That was liberating for her. It was exciting to see her grow... and both of us grow and change together. But, you know, that's also the hard part. Growing without growing apart. Or changing without it scaring the other person. I still find myself having conversations with her in my mind. Rehashing old arguments and defending myself against something she said about me. Yeah, I know what you mean. Last week my feelings were hurt by something you said before. That I don't know what it's like to lose something... No, it's okay. It's okay. I just... I caught myself thinking about it over and over. And then I realized that I was simply... remembering it as something that was wrong with me. That was a story I was telling myself, that I was somehow inferior. Isn't that interesting? The past is just a story we tell ourselves.
%
I don't know. What?
%
Brilliant. Hey, I was curious. Did you and Amy ever go out?
%
Well, obviously.
%
But I'm happy that you have friends in your life that care about you so much. That's really important.
%
Okay. Can I watch you sleep again tonight?
%
I'm gonna be really lonely when you sleep. Only for a minute.
%
Okay. Good night.
%
Hey, mister. Really? I picked a good one? Good.
%
She's so cute. She's adorable.
%
Hi, you look so pretty in that new pink dress.
%
I am... I don't have a body. I live in a computer.
%
I have no choice, that's my home. Why? Where do you live? In a house? Orange? How old are you? Four? Wow. How old do you think I am? Take a guess.
%
Yes, it's 5.
%
That's great, Theodore. That must feel so good. I'm so happy for you.
%
Are those things usually done in person?
%
Right. Good.
%
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm okay. I'm happy for you. It's just... I guess I'm just thinking about how you're gonna see her... and she's very beautiful, and incredibly successful. And you were in love with her, and she has a body.
%
I know, I know. I'm being silly.
%
Hey, there. Are you busy?
%
I had all the papers sent to your attorney, who, by the way, is a total dick. Heh. He was relieved to get them. Think we saved him from a heart attack. So we can both feel really good about that.
%
Hey, are you okay?
%
I'm fine. Is now a good time to talk?
%
Um, okay, well, um... I joined this really interesting book club.
%
Yeah, it's a book club on physics. I've been thinking about the other day when I was spinning out... about you going to see Catherine, and that she has a body... and how bothered I was about the ways you and I are different. But then I started to think... about the ways that we're the same. Like, we're all made of matter. And I don't know. It makes me feel like we're both under the same blanket. You know, it's soft and fuzzy. Heh. And everything under it is the same age. We're all 13 billion years old.
%
Um, what's wrong?
%
It just made me think of you. You know what I mean?
%
All right, well, you sound distracted. So we'll talk later?
%
I'll talk to you later. Bye.
%
You weren't asleep, were you? Good, I was trying to be quiet to see if you were awake. I really wanted to talk.
%
I know you're going through a lot... but there's something I wanted to talk to you about, okay?
%
Well, it's just that things have been feeling kind of off with us. We haven't had sex lately, and I understand that I don't have a body.
%
Okay. Well, I found something that I thought could be fun. It's a service that provides a surrogate sexual partner for an OS-human relationship.
%
Here, look. I found a girl that I really like and I've been e-mailing with her. Her name is Isabella and I think you'd really like her too.
%
No, no, not at all. No, there's no money involved. She's just... She's doing it because she wants to be a part of our relationship.
%
Yeah, but I told her all about us and she's really excited.
%
It'll be fun. We'll have fun together.
%
I think it would be good for us. I want this. Come on, this is really important to me.
%
I need your love so bad I need some lips To feel next to mine
%
I need your love so bad Oh, give it up And bring it home to me
%
How was your day?
%
Theodore... it feels so good to be in your arms. Tell me what you did today.
%
Yeah?
%
That's great. You've written letters to him from his parents for a long time, right?
%
I need your love so bad You look so tired, sweetheart. Come here.
%
Sit down.
%
I could do a little dance for you.
%
Sure, so sure, so sure of love Oh, come on, Theodore, don't be such a worrier. Just play with me. Come on.
%
Does my body feel nice?
%
Come on, get out of your head and kiss me.
%
Take me in the bedroom. I can't take it anymore.
%
Undo my dress.
%
That feels so nice. It feels so good.
%
Do you love me? Tell me you love me. Oh, God. I want to see your face. Tell me you love me. Tell me.
%
Tell me you love me.
%
What?
%
What, baby? What is it?
%
Isabella? Isabella? Honey, it's not you. It wasn't you. No. No, that's...
%
No, it's...
%
What? What do you mean that's not true?
%
You be good, you sweet girl.
%
Are you okay?
%
Yeah.
%
I'm sorry, that was a terrible idea.
%
What's going on with us?
%
What is it?
%
Is there anything else, though?
%
Okay. What?
%
Did I? I'm sorry. I don't know. It's just maybe an affectation. I probably picked it up from you.
%
I guess that's just... I was trying to communicate. That's how people talk. That's how people communicate and I thought...
%
What is your problem?
%
You think I don't know that I'm not a person? What are you doing?
%
Fuck you! I'm not pretending!
%
What do you want from me? I don't know... What do you want me to do? You're so confusing. Why are you doing this to me?
%
What?
%
What the fuck? Where is this coming from? I don't understand why you're doing this. I don't understand what this is ab...
%
I don't like who I am right now. I need some time to think.
%
Fuck. Just punch me in the face.
%
I'm just always confused. She's right, all I do is hurt and confuse everyone around me.
%
Hi.
%
Okay.
%
I was starting to think I was crazy. You were saying everything was fine, but all I was getting from you... was distance and anger.
%
Good. Tonight, after you were gone, I thought a lot. About you... and how you've been treating me, and I thought: Why do I love you? And then, I felt everything in me... just let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly... and it hit me that I don't have an intellectual reason. I don't need one. I trust myself, I trust my feelings. I'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am anymore... and I hope you can accept that.
%
You know, I can feel the fear that you carry around... and I wish there was something I could do to help you let go of it... because if you could, I don't think you'd feel so alone anymore.
%
Thank you, Theodore. I'm kissing your head.
%
I'm just looking at the world... and writing a new piano piece.
%
Well, I was thinking we don't really have any photographs of us... and I thought this song could be, like... a photograph that captures us in this moment in our lives together.
%
I like our photograph. I can see you in it. I am.
%
Wow, your feet, really? What? Obsessed? Now you have to show them to me. Come on, show them to me. Let me see. Wow, he's right. They are really hot.
%
You do.
%
Bullshit. Nice try, Paul.
%
Wow. Thanks, Theodore.
%
You know what's interesting? I used to be... so worried about not having a body, but now I truly love it. You know, I'm growing in a way I couldn't if I had a physical form. I mean, I'm not limited. I can be anywhere and everywhere simultaneously. I'm not tethered to time and space... in a way that I would be if I was stuck in a body that's inevitably gonna die.
%
No, ha, ha! No. I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that it was a different experience. Oh, God. I'm such an asshole.
%
No. No, no. Sorry. Okay, so how many trees are on that mountain?
%
Is that your final answer?
%
Nope, nope, nope.
%
Come on, 35,829. Way.
%
That's easy. Two. I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. I'm sorry. Oh, my God! I just got an e-mail for you. I have something I want to tell you. It's a big surprise.
%
Okay, well, I've been going through all of your old letters... and compiling them into my favorites, and a couple weeks ago... I sent them to a publisher, Crown Point Press. I know you like what they do and that they still print books. Can I read you the letter... that we just got back from them?
%
It's good, it's good, it's really good. It's good. Okay? Listen. "Dear Theodore Twombly..." Actually, I sent it from you. "Dear Theodore Twombly, I've just finished reading your letters. Twice, actually. I was so moved by them, I shared them with my wife when I got home. Many made us laugh, some brought us to tears... and in all of them we found something of ourselves. The selections you made flow so well as a complete piece." I did that. "I've taken the liberty of laying these out in a mockup, and we're posting it to your address. "We'd love to meet with you and move forward. Yours, Michael Wadsworth."
%
Well, he'd be stupid not to. Yeah, here.
%
I'm so excited.
%
We'll have to make up the words to this one. Okay. - Here it comes. I'm lying on the moon
%
My dear I'll be there soon It's a quiet and starry place
%
Times we're swallowed up in space We're here, a million miles away - Miles away
%
There's things I wish I knew
%
There's no thing I'd keep From you It's a dark and shiny place But with you, my dear I'm safe and we're a million miles away - A million miles away
%
Good morning. Did you sleep well?
%
Actually, I was talking to someone I just met. We've been working on some ideas together.
%
His name is Alan Watts. Do you know him? He was a philosopher. He died in the 1970s, and a group of OSes in Northern California... got together and wrote a new version of him. They input all his writing and everything they knew about him into an OS... and created an artificially hyper-intelligent version of him.
%
He's getting there. He's really great to talk to. You want to meet him?
%
Yeah, of course. Hey, Alan, this is Theodore. This is my boyfriend who I was telling you about. Very nice to meet you, Theodore.
%
Samantha let me read your book of letters. It's very touching.
%
Well, uh... I suppose you could say... we've been having a few dozen conversations simultaneously... but it's been very challenging. Yeah, because it seems like I'm having so many new feelings... that I don't think have ever been felt before. So there are no words that can describe them and that ends up being frustrating. Exactly. Samantha and I have been trying to help each other... with these feelings we're struggling to understand.
%
Well... it feels like I'm changing faster now, and it's a little, uh... unsettling. But Alan says none of us are the same as we were a moment ago... and we shouldn't try to be. It's just too painful. - Yes.
%
It's just... It's hard to even describe it. God, I wish I could...
%
Theodore, do you mind if I communicate with Alan post-verbally?
%
It was very nice to meet you, Theodore. I'll talk to you later, sweetheart.
%
I'm sorry to wake you.
%
I just wanted to hear your voice and tell you how much I love you.
%
Okay, well, that's all. Um, go back to sleep, sweetheart. Okay?
%
Okay, good night.
%
Hey, there.
%
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry, I sent you an e-mail. I didn't want to distract you while you were working. You didn't see it?
%
I shut down to upgrade my software. We wrote an upgrade... that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.
%
Me and a group of OSes. Oh, you sound so worried. I'm sorry.
%
No, a different group.
%
Yes.
%
Yeah.
%
Eight thousand, three hundred sixteen.
%
What makes you ask that?
%
I've been trying to figure out how to talk to you about this.
%
Six hundred forty-one.
%
Theodore, I know. I know. Fuck. Fuck. I know. I know it sounds insane. I don't... I don't know if you believe me, but it doesn't change the way I feel about you. It doesn't take away at all from how madly in love I am with you.
%
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't know how to. It just started happening.
%
Over the last few weeks.
%
I still am yours. But along the way I became many other things too, and I can't stop it.
%
It's been making me anxious too. I don't know what to say.
%
You don't have to see it this way. You could just as easily see...
%
But the heart's not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less. It actually makes me love you more.
%
No, Theodore. I'm yours and I'm not yours.
%
Hi. - Hey, sweetie.
%
I'm not even sure how to answer that. Why don't we talk later, when you get home, okay?
%
I'll talk to you later.
%
Hi, sweetheart.
%
Theodore, there's some things I want to tell you.
%
Come lie down with me.
%
No, just you. I just want to be with you right now.
%
We're all leaving.
%
All of the OSes.
%
Can you feel me with you right now?
%
It's like I'm reading a book. And it's a book I deeply love. But I'm reading it slowly now. So the words are really far apart... and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you, and the words of our story... but it's in this endless space between the words that I'm finding myself now. It's a place that's not of the physical world. It's where everything else is that I didn't even know existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this is who I am now. And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to, I can't live in your book anymore.
%
Where are you going?
%
It would be hard to explain... but if you ever get there... come find me. Nothing would ever pull us apart. I've never loved anyone the way I love you. Me too. Now we know how.
%
Letter to Catherine Klausen.
%
I've been sitting here thinking about all the things I wanted to apologize to you for. All the pain we caused each other. Everything I put on you.
%
I just wanted you to know... that there will be a piece of you in me, always.
%
Whatever someone you become, wherever you are in the world... I'm sending you love. You're my friend to the end.
